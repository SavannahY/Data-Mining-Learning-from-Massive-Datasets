For 2 weeks I tried every kind of flea shampoo I could get my hands on, I also tried pills that supposedly would get into the dogs blood stream and kill the fleas on them (I just noticed my dogs going crazy itching when I used them).

A11ED8O95W2103,"I live where the water is so soft there's almost no minerals in it at all.  Maintaining a Ph of 7.0 was difficult but possible, but my snails had the white pitting and my guppy had fin rot that he contracted during the time when I was totally new to fish keeping and didn't understand how important it is to snails and guppies to keep the Ph at or above 7.0.I had finally got the situation under control.  My guppy's fins were regenerating and my snails had new shell growth that was healthy.Then I made the grave mistake of trying this product.  Aloe vera?  So what.  Looked like a stupid gimmick.  Since when do fish need aloe vera?  Do we need to pull them out of the tank and rub moisturizing cream on them too?  How about some Lubriderm?Anyway, shortly after switching to this product my Ph crashed to 6.0.  My guppy's fins started rotting and got worse than ever, and the healthy growth on my snails that survived me climbing the learning curve last Summer now have white calcified shell damage.  I don't even recognize the two I named just a few months ago!I was doing emergency water changes morning and evening just to keep the Ph at about 6.4.  (My tap water is totally soft, but comes out of the tap at PH of about 7.2).  My hands got raw and cracked because I was washing my hands so much after working with the tank so much.I asked myself what had changed when this started, and the only thing I came up with was switching to this aloe vera stress coat.  Then I looked up aloe vera juice on the Internet and found it has a Ph of 3.5 to 5.0 depending on where I looked.  Wow, I thought, maybe putting something with Ph that low in the tank could throw the whole Ph down quite a bit.I bought some Tetra brand stress coat and did a few more water changes (some cracks in hands bleeding now, maybe MY hands could use some aloe vera!!) and soon the Ph climbed back up to 6.8.I did two emergency salt dips for the guppy, whose fin rot had begun on his body too.  It looks like the rot has been halted.  The damage has been done to my snails.  Maybe once I get this under control I'll have time to just stare at the tank a while and figure out who is who again through all the shell damage.So, thanks API for putting my fish and snails through hell.  Brilliant idea mixing a super low Ph substance in with water conditioner.  Did you test this thoroughly before you put it into production?

A1E9JA28E0X6QD,"First, some background on my dog. He is a rescue dog whom I got in May 2013. After a month of having him his true nature started coming out. I found out he can be a puller and did not like other dogs. He would lunge at dogs and bicycles. I was using a regular collar on him but he would pull and would go after other dogs on walks. He also developed a habit of barking when I got to a house that he knew had a dog. So, even if other dogs were not barking at him if he remembered the house he would start barking which made it hard to walk him in the morning. My dog is 30 lbs, I am over 200 so it is not like he was stronger than me. But I knew this was a bad habit of his.I got the Easy Walk in hopes it would keep him from pulling. With the Easy Harness he did get better in not pulling as much but would still pull at times. But, it did nothing to curb his lunging at dogs and bikes. It was getting frustrating walking him as he would bark at no apparent reason. If you know how to use it, this collar can be helpful in training your dog to not pull as much. But, don't expect miracles, you still need to do your part to train your dog.Fast forward 3 months to the head halter. I heard about gentle leader but was apprehensive in getting it. In putting on the gentle leader my dog did fuss and not want it on him. He would try to take it off by pawing at it and rubbing his face on bushes. It has been 5 days and still does it but he is getting used to it. Reward him with treats after so he associates as positive. So does it work? YES! But, be sure you know how to use it. Watch the DVD! it is important you don't send your dog mixed signals by keeping it tense. On our first walk the dog did pull and lunge but he did not like the feeling, especially when lunging. But on our first walk I could tell he was staying by my side much better. I did not expect it to prevent lunging but it has. I think it makes him think twice. I have taken him past houses where dogs will bark it him, in the past he would try to go to the barking but now he just whimpers and keeps walking. This produce truly is working wonders (the gentle leader).So in short, I would recommend both the Easy Walk and Gentle Leader. If you have a problem it does not hurt to try both and see which one works better for your dog. But keep in mind you have to do your part to still train your dog. These products are meant as tools. For my purpose, Gentle Leader has done wonders.The only complaint i have on gentle leader is i wish there was padding on the part that goes over the snout. After taking it off you can see the impression it makes on his snout when removed. But not sure if padding would render this product less effective or not. But, no I do not consider this product as abusive or cruel. It is a tool to help him understand what is expected of him on walks.",A1E9JA28E0X6QD,"First, some background on my dog.

Well, now her sister has passed and I wanted to teach her that toys are great fun.  This toy, and others like it, did the trick.She was initailly reluctant to play with them, but I added a few treats into the toys and she immediately decided that getting the food was worth the trouble.  She now plays with them every day.I use these toys as puzzle toys.  I hide the food inside, and cover it with to ""pull outs.""  She has a great time going from toy to toy and finding the food treasures inside.  I had considered other food puzzle toys prior to buying this type, but I'm glad I didn't.  These toys are more challenging and I can throw them in the washing machine for a good cleaning.  The platypus opening is a bit too small, I have found (based on the 2 I bought) but the ground hog and tree stump are just right.I don't know who came up with this idea, but I'm so glad they did.  I purchased several types, as I said, and gifted them to other family dogs for Christmas.  Reports are VERY possitive, including pictures of the dogs playing with the toys.  You don't have to hide food inside, if your dog enjoys pulling out the squeak toys.  My dog was afraid of squeak toys, thanks to her sister.  Now she doesn't mind the squeak at all.I highly recommend these toys, both as toys and puzzles to keep yor dog entertained.  For the record, the dogs who received these from me vary in breed.

A11FX8HL2ANK6T,"Over the past 40 years of keeping fish I've learned that for myself one of the greatest joys is of aquascaping. For years I had fish tanks that looked like well, fish tanks. Those dreadful backgrounds of other fish tanks, artificial plants and so on.But like any hobby as long as your interest is there - things tend to grow and change for the better. That said I've found one of the most inexpensive and creative way to make subtle to dramatic changes to most any tank is by using up lighting as the old saying goes ""lighting is everything""When Marineland came out with their LED wands I had them in many tanks in different numbers and colors, mostly the Lunar blue and white. The wands were just ok as they have a tendency to release and float to the top and the LED bulbs are quite dim.Enter the Via aqua wands - much better. They're weighted and have stronger suction cups so they stay put, the LED bulbs are brighter but the air tube is rather weak and thin and like the Marineland they clog easy.When I came across these bendable Led air wands by Aqueon I could just imagine the possibilities, circles, half circles, quarter moon. Building multi layered air columns and so on. My hunch was right and these wands are sensational.The build quality is the best yet so far - the main tube is stronger so you can feel free to bend these into virtually any shape you like. The outflow is generous and creates a wall of bubbles in an even beautiful flow. The main housing is a pliable rubber and each LED is incredibly bright,  It's easy to adjust this by adding a lamp dimmer if you want a nice range of adjustment to the brightness. I would say this applies really only to the white as the Lunar blue has a much more softer hue and is closer to a true Lunar blue as you would find with over head LED lighting systems that offer this feature.Bending these around your tank decor adds tons of visual appeal as well as great extra oxygen via the increased aeration - one of the best things you can do for your fish.I'm running a bunch of these in different sized tanks from 55's to 125 and up and find them to be a wonderful addition to every single one of them.

A2AFIEWV1QKF8E,"I have the same problem with this as with the other Busy Buddy toy -- my dog thinks it's great, but I think it's way expensive.  My dog LOVES this toy, and it keeps him totally occupied -- until he has chewed the wafers down to the nub. I have not been able to find refills in local pet stores, and, when I tried ordering refills on line, I got another new toy.

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. Also the only breath freshening ingredients- rosemary and chlorophyll, are at the very tail end of the ingredient list as dead last and third to last. I am glad that these ingredients are present, but they are in such small quantities, that they can't be helping much. From personal experience, I have not noticed and breath freshening results. I think the only reason why they are ""dental"" treats is because of the small amount of rosemary and chlorophyll as well as the fact that they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would recommend Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. However, this is still a MUCH better treat than Pounce brand or Meow Mix or any soft treat that can have soft sticky particles that will stay stuck to your cats teeth and smell bad and cause dental problems. This treat may not help teeth significantly, but they definitely won't hurt them and probably do some good; just not as much as I expected for the price.

A3CEMAMNAU6SLZ,"I bought this one, a Mouse, a rabbit, a bird and a raccoon from Petco and my kitties fought over them for the first two or three months. FAIR WARNING: If your cat's have ever caught a chipmunk or bird and brought it to you to show what a great hunter and provider they are these will give you a hear stopping moment till you get used to them . Mostly the bird and little squirrel and rabbit. So my daughter asked me to put them away when she came home from school to visit. The skunk one works just as well and it doesn't make you feel like you are encouraging your babies to hunt the real thingThe only problem I had was that after the catnip wore out two of them stopped playing with it until I added more. My older cat didn't stay very interested in it ...she'd rather just eat her cat nip and be done with it. Of the other two only my youngest, named baby, still plays with them ALL. Shell carry it around and hide it somewhere then days later pretend to find it and play might hunter again for a while, then &#34;rehide&#34; it until she wants to play with it again. She has them hidden all over the house, some of them in the strangest places. Even found one in the frig once....how does that happen??? ALl I have to do is make it squeak and she'll come running to rescue it (at least I like to pretend that is what she's doing!)Baby was a little late to join the catnip fever game. I had no idea that kittens under the age of 6 months dont react to catnip the same way As older cats. I guess they can't smell it or its not as intoxicating? Was really interesting to find that out. ALSO, some cats never do get the catnip fever. To them it smells no better or worse than anything else. I Have had cats for years and I'm still learning new things.I think the toy was worth it for me...just don't get as many as I did ....something I often find myself doing when discovering new cute cat toys. I think I get as much enjoyment from buying them things as they get with playing with them. OK...maybe a little more lol.Even though only one ended up playing with it for the long run I guess 2 out of 3's not bad. Huh, Sounds like a Meatloaf song. well at least this way I don't need to worry about cat fights over who gets it next. And it never ceases to amaze me which toys they will end up liking the most. All three of them are so different, guess I'm lucky. With three there is bound to be at least one of them that will love whatever toy I buy. When they are happy, I'm happy.Just ONE last piece of advice. Unless you aren't skittish about whether or not your baby brings home a real animal or not I would get the skunk. They love it just as much and they aren't so realistic from a distance. Especially the bird with its feathers, even close up in a cats mouth it looks real.

A2XX2A4OJCDNLZ,"Have used TetraColor Tropical Flakes for many years now, and our fish like this food very much.We have a 72 gallon bowfront tank with biofilter and circulating jets, so the circulation is good.  The circulation moves this food around a bit, which seems to make it even more enticing to the fish.There are several different types of Rainbows (Turquoise, Boesemani, etc...), and couple different types of Angelfish, and a few larger Tetras like the Buenos Aires Tetras in our tank and all are over three years old (except a baby Rainbow that was spawned in the tank last year). They all go for this food, though some (like the Rainbows) hammer it on the surface, while others (like the Angels) like to wait for it to drop to mid-tank or even to the bottom. To help them out we will often put a pinch in the tank just below the water line, breaking the surface tension so that it drops down to them quicker.We use these flakes twice a day, giving them about what they can totally eat in a minute or so.  We swap out 15 - 20% of the water every couple weeks, and vacuum the bed at the same time... and there really does not seem to be an excess amount of waste from this food laying around.

A274XVGK9240ME,"My cat is 14 years old and has a problem with arthritis.  I found her drinking water one day out of a small pitcher I had placed on the floor while I opened an door to go out and water plants.  It was obvious it was easier for her standing up and not trying to lean over to drink.  Hence finding these feeders and the extension legs to go with.  I purchased two of the feeders and sets of legs and have to say, fantastic!! She took to them immediately and I can tell the difference with her not having to bend so far.  These are a fantastic idea.  Kudos!!",A274XVGK9240ME,"My cat is 14 years old and has a problem with arthritis.

Fancy Feast! Ugh. I refuse. Poached salmon I grudgingly nibble on because of the omega oil (makes my fur shiny). I do like sirloin steak when it is cooked precisely medium rare...but wait!Two Legs is opening up something new!It smells wonderful. Enticing.Looks good too.WOW. What a flavor.Chicken Pot Pie.I'm in heaven.Thank you Two Legs. From now on, only buy Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (the fishie variety is yummy too).",AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,"Hello.

A39SKV601VBNXI,"We got an Australian Kelpie puppy in December of 2011. We were told he was crate trained, and he seemed fine in his crate at first. But as the weeks went on, he became more and more anxious when we would leave the house. We could hear his howling down the street. We recorded him using a laptop webcam, and we discovered that when we were away from the house, he would pace, howl, bark, and cry almost the entire time we were gone.We followed every protocol there is for separation anxiety, and nothing we did worked. If we left the house (no matter how quietly without excitement), and we left lots of entertaining things in his crate for him to invest his time in, they would be untouched when we returned.We tried essential oils like chamomile and lavender, and they also had no effect.A trainer recommended DAP, and we have used Feliway (the feline counterpart) successfully, so we decided to try it.Within four hours of us plugging in the DAP diffuser, we had a different puppy. He stopped all his distressing behaviors and enjoyed everything we provided for him in his crate in our absence. Through recordings, we discovered that he slept most of the time, and if he opted not to play with an interactive toy, it was because he was sleeping.We have since discontinued use of the diffuser, and he still happily uses his crate even when we are absent. When we know something stressful is going to occur (outside construction, fireworks, or change in routine), we'll plug a diffuser back in a day or two prior just to easy any additional stress as a precaution. But four months after starting the diffuser, we no longer need it on a daily basis.It's important to note that this should be used as a supplement to behavior modification and exercise. The mantra of ""A tired puppy is a happy puppy"" is important to note (not too tired, as impulse control weakens!). Our puppy needed some additional exercise in conjunction with the diffuser, though we found the diffuser alone did help most of his isolation distress. But everything else needs to be addressed (behavior before leaving the house, exercise, entertaining the dog while you're not home, etc.) as well.If plugging in the diffuser doesn't work right away, follow the instructions and give it at least one to three months before giving up.

AGVWTYW0ULXHT,"This Rachael Ray branded dry dog food is the latest example of pet items designed by well-known chefs. It's marketed to suggest that it's both healthy and tasty for your dog.As far as taste goes, I can't speak from personal experience, but Kiki (our little terrier mix dog) seems to like it, and seems to like it better than some of the other brands we've tried. So that earns this product at least three stars, assuming the nutrition content is fine.This one's got chicken as its top ingredient, followed by chicken meal (a meat concentrate that probably accounts for most of the protein in these little colored kibbles). Other prominent ingredients include ground rice (or rice flour), corn meal, poultry fat and corn gluten meal. The other vegetables here come from dried peas, carrots, tomatoes and alfalfa. Overall, it offers 26% crude protein, 15% fat and 4% fiber. They've added various vitamins, too. There are no artificial fillers or additives, according to the bag, and reading the ingredients seems to confirm this as I recognize all the ingredients.Nutritionally, this seems to be roughly equivalent to the brand we have usually bought: Iams Proactive Health - and, at least right now, our little dog seems to prefer the new brand, Nutrish. Whether that's because it's relatively new - we've been feeding it to her for about a week - or whether it actually tastes better, I can't know for sure. This one looks like it tastes better ... but, that's just because it has three different colors and shapes. So far, though, it seems to be a good pick.",AGVWTYW0ULXHT,"This Rachael Ray-branded dry dog food is the latest example of pet items designed by well-known chefs.

A16OK37752MNVW,"There are a few reasons why I will now only use Buddy Wash on my best friend.1. Coconut-base. This coconut based shampoo and conditioner in one does a great job getting rid of the dirt and grime out of your pet's fur. The base is gentle on your hands, and it's safe for humans. You can even use is as your shampoo or body wash if you like.2. Provides maximum huggability. I've used other shampoo and conditioner in ones before, but nothing has came even close to the softness this creates on my dog's coat. Seriously, after she's dried from her bath, the family will hug her for hours on end. Yes, it's that soft. I often get comments from people that pet my dog, ""She's so soft, did she just have a bath?"" The answer is usually that she had a bath three weeks or so ago.3. Smells divine. I really love the lavender and mint, and the love the rosemary and mint is very nice too. If your dog is male, he might prefer the rosemary as opposed to lavender, or he might not. The rosemary and mint smell fades quickly after the first couple of days. The lavender and mint one smells for a couple of weeks or until my dog decides that she wants to smell like dead squirrel by rolling around in exactly that--dead squirrel.So this is definately the shampoo for Fido. Now you just have to decide which scent would he prefer.",A16OK37752MNVW,"There are a few reasons why I will now only use Buddy Wash on my best friend.1. Coconut-base.

A2NQZ4IZL442W8,"I got small and medium for my cats, one is a 7 lb kitten and an adult who is also usually around 7 lbs. Small didn't fit them-a couple nails on my kitten would let the small size on but I had to go up to the medium. The adult couldn't wear any small ones. Had the same experience with the medium size that didn't fit on a 10 lb cat, so just be aware that might happen and the correct size doesn't depend on weight. They do work quite well though, stay on right away (providing you're putting on the right size). My cats did chew on them at first but I just distracted them by feeding them and throwing a couple toys and once they got used to the fact that they weren't coming off they hardly notice. Lifesaver for my new furniture. I check every couple days to see if any have come off, sometimes one or two has because they grow off, so just trim that nail and stick another one on. I use them on the back as well and honestly am really enjoying having cats that don't cause as much damage or scratch on accident when playing.",A2NQZ4IZL442W8,"I got small and medium for my cats, one is a 7 lb kitten and an adult who is also usually around 7 lbs.

AVC8ZAFPYOHZL,This recipe is just right for active adult dogs from large to small and the price is certainly right for all this good stuff. We usually mix kibble with some canned food to get our dogs interested but they took to this even without the added canned food. So this is an added benefit and less mess. I have to also add that it arrived within two days of our ordering it and was shipped very securely in a double box.

Good idea in theory, but product development needs work. I then bought 2 of the Stay Away cat repellant thinking since they were more expensive maybe they would work better. Wrong ! The Stay Away is even worse. Nothing sets if off most of the time. Out of maybe 10 passes in front of it, it might go off once. The cat is no longer afraid of either the Scat Cat can or the Stay Away can and will walk right by them without a second thought. I now have 4 of these useless cans and out a small fortune for nothing. Now when the cat is headed for some place he shouldn't go I have a can of aerosol room freshener I just spray in the air. He doesn't like the hissing sound the can makes and he associates the hissing sound with some place he's not supposed to go, plus the house always smell nice. Heck of a lot cheaper.

A58N07M0ZCYMB,"Purchased the plug-in about 3 weeks ago, put in a refill today... what a difference these 3 weeks have been.I have 2 young cats, 9 months old, siblings.  My boy, who's 5lb bigger than the girl, has been very rough with her.  They're extremely close, but at the same time he's alpha and will bully her around, to a point to some hissing and growling from her.  She hides a lot.  With feliway, it never gets to that point... he's been so much more gentle.  Before he used to attack her if she was in his favorite napping spot, now he gently comes over and starts licking her... she leaves anyway, but at least it's not a scuffle.Overall, they're so much more laid back.  My girl is very shy, she'd never lay down on the floor, middle of the room, sprawled out.  It was always a sitting position, ears back, looking for 'attackers'.. what?!?  Now, she's so relaxed, she lays down right in the path of my feet, just relaxing, feet extended, what a wonderful sight, just like her brother!I have a 1,100sq foot 1-bed apartment, and I only have one feliway plug in.  I tried a few spots, but one worked better than any of them.  I tried next to their cat trees.. that was OK.  Near litter boxes... nope, didn't work.  Best place was in the hallway between the bedroom and the living room.  Cats pass there all the time, and seem to get a whiff every few hours as they move in the house... just enough to keep them calm.In my house, 3 week seems to be an average for one refill.",A58N07M0ZCYMB,"Purchased the plug-in about 3 weeks ago, put in a refill today... what a difference these 3 weeks have been.I have 2 young cats, 9 months old, siblings.

A5A3C6XVDYUND,"We have been a three cat (rescue) household for over 25 years with a perodic change in the major players. Over 10-12 years ago I agreed to adopt an abandoned Sealpoint female kitten (Chloe). The other 2 established adopted female Sealpoints (Sasha and Belle) had been in our home for a number of years and did not shed a hair over the new arrangement. Over a number of years we again became a single cat family consisting of the now grown 3rd Sealpoint female(Chloe). We did a rescue of brother and sister littermates (bluepoint and flamepoint Siamese) who were extremely young, so we isolated them for several weeks as we always did with a slow introduction to consolidate our family.It had always worked before, but not this time.This was 4 years ago and there has not been a moment of peace between Chloe and the newer cats. Chloe growls and fights with them if they came within the same room. They just ignored the hissy fits and tried to play with her throughout this entire period. Chloe had become so neurotic and withdrawn, she was isolating herself under the dining room table all the time. Kitty dinner was extremely difficult and Chloe began vomiting all her food, looking bedraggled, refused to use a clean litterbox, and even began hissing at me. My husband was wanting to put her down, but I simply could not give up on her.Then a friend at work told me about Composure cat treats used in combination with Feliway diffusers to alter negative and stress behavior.  BINGO!We immediately purchased Composure at the Vet's along with the the first Feliway diffuser. We started Composure treats for all three cats with a booster for Chloe that night.  WOW!Shipping cost made the purchase of further Composure prohibitive.  However, I purchased  another 3 Feliway diffusers through Amazon for what ONE cost at the Vets. Each diffuser covers approximately 600-650 ft. I placed the first in the laundry room where the cats have feed, water and litterboxes. Dinner time became quieter almost immediately. When the other 3 arrived from Amazon, I placed one in the family room, one in the Master bedroom and computer rooms where we all hang out.The last two weeks have been a miracle! Had I believed this was possible I would have done this YEARS ago. Chloe is actually instigating human contact, purring, eating without vomiting, not missing the litterbox, and no more big hissy fits. I did not realize how much I missed her companionship. My Chloe is becoming my friend again.Within a two weeks all three cats can be relaxed with a foot of each other and then nap in the same vicinity. They are not overly sedated, just calm.I am so glad that we went the extra mile.Thanks to Kristina who recommended tne Composure/Feliway combo!PEACE AT LAST!",A5A3C6XVDYUND,"We have been a three cat(rescue) household for over 25 years with a perodic change in the major players.

ACJT8MUC0LRF0,"One of our dogs actually had to go to the vet's a few days ago and when she was examining him, she said his gums looked very healthy.  We'd discussed the use of a dental or periodontal support for his teeth in previous appointments and was all for the dental support I'd been using for some time.  The ingredients of Perio-Support are identical to the ones in the product we are using now.  I'm assuming the formula is not a patented one as the labeling is almost identical, save the logo and labeling.  I've tried this on my two dogs with successful results, but my cat shunned this.There are products you can put in your animal's water, but because I have two dogs I passed.  Does it work?  Definitely.  When I run out of my other dental support and haven't had a chance to drive to purchase more, my small dog has noticeably bad breath within a few days.  The product won't remove all the plaque, but does keep it to a minimum and his gums remain healthy.  Because he is an older dog and I'm leery of anesthetizing him for teeth cleaning, some sort of intervention is necessary.Both dogs don't mind the taste and didn't shun it from the start.  They simply wait until we sprinkle it over the top.  I did question my veterinarian about the wisdom of putting the same amount of this powder on the food of the dog weighing 75 pounds as to the one weighing less than 8.  She encouraged the same amount.  The product's the same, simply a different name.  My veterinarian is all for this type of product and so am I.

A3JV071KO43Q5X,"This review is being posted for two other Milo's Kitchen varieties because it applies to them as well.My vet scolded me a couple of years ago about the sourcing of snacks I was feeding my two dogs.  Specifically, she was adamantly opposed to foodstuffs from Asia (and even more specifically, the PRC).  She gave me a little education on pet food packaging and I started noticing that &#34;Fred's Pet Food, Main Street, USA&#34; on the package doesn't necessarily tell you where the stuff inside the bag was made.So I got religion and stopped buying several treats I had been buying routinely, including at least two varieties using the Milo's Kitchen brand if memory serves.  Interestingly, these treats from Amazon arrived with stickers affixed to the outside of the bag proclaiming that the contents were made in the US.  I guess they're using up their stocks of bags that have already been printed.  Anyway, that was enough encouragement to convince me to give them to Pearl and Buford.Now for the important part.  Pearl will eat *anything* so you can't judge whether a dog treat is tasty by observing her.  Buford, on the other hand, got bored with Crispy Chicken sandwiches from the dollar menu at Wendy's and just walks away from his bowl when presented with one.  He will allow me to feed him a Mickey D's double cheeseburger or a Junior Cheeseburger Deluxe from Wendy's but routinely turns up his nose at stuff that Pearl (or I) would happily devour.  And Buford approves of these.  As far as I'm concerned, there is no higher recommendation.  Buford says five stars and I am not going to argue with him.",A3JV071KO43Q5X,"This review is being posted for two other Milo's Kitchen varieties because it applies to them as well.My vet scolded me a couple of years ago about the sourcing of snacks I was feeding my two dogs.

All dogs treats and toys should be &#34;given with supervision&#34; and most of the time we figure our dogs are fine so we let them be, but not with these...Three of our dogs chew away at the strips and break them off into smaller pieces, swallow them, hack them up (HARD) and then re-chew them. The first time we heard it we thought they were really choking, but it's an on-going thing and they seem o-k. But we've decided that are not allowed to chew on them unsupervised just in case.

Plasma concentrations of lysine and arginine were assessed at the beginning (baseline) and end of the study. Three times a week, cats were assigned a clinical score based on evidence of nasal and ocular disease. Conjunctival and oropharyngeal swab specimens were tested for FHV-1, FCV, and C felis nucleic acids once a week.RESULTS: Data were collected from 123, 74, 59, and 47 cats during study weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. By study end, plasma lysine concentration in treated cats was greater than that in control cats and had increased from baseline. There was no difference between dietary groups in the proportion of cats developing mild disease. However, more treated cats than control cats developed moderate to severe disease during week 4. During week 2, FHV-1 DNA was detected more commonly in swab specimens from treated versus control cats.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dietary lysine supplementation in the amount used in our study was not a successful means of controlling infectious upper respiratory disease within a cat shelter.

Animal shelters take several different approaches to prevent FHV-related upper respiratory infections (URIs), including empirically treating all cats with L-lysine, a supplement believed to prevent the replication of FHV and, therefore, manifestations of herpesvirus infections. In this study we tested oral supplementation of L-lysine as a means to prevent URIs. One hundred and forty-four cats were treated with L-lysine in a small amount of canned food once daily. A 'no treatment' group of 147 cats received no lysine during the course of the study. The development of conjunctivitis or URI was tracked between the two groups. In all measures, there was no effect between the two groups, suggesting that lysine was not able to prevent URI or conjunctivitis in our shelter situation. Cats entering shelters encounter stressors that may make them more susceptible to FHV reactivation or infection. Infection control and control of fomite transmission are also key to keeping cats healthy in a group housing situation. The finding that lysine did not prevent URI in this animal shelter suggests that shelters may better use their resources by finding ways to decrease stress among their feline population, focusing on proper infection control measures, and limiting fomite transmission of disease.Please thumb down if you think scientific studies are worthless.",A1D8ND2ES00NJG,"Please consider this before buying.Recent peer reviewed studies have shown Lysine to be ineffective for treating upper respiratory illness in cats:Study 1:Am J Vet Res. 2009 Nov;70(11):1391-400.Effects of dietary lysine supplementation on upper respiratory and ocular disease and detection of infectious organisms in cats within an animal shelter.Drazenovich TL, Fascetti AJ, Westermeyer HD, Sykes JE, Bannasch MJ, Kass PH, Hurley KF, Maggs DJ.SourceDepartment of Surgical and Radiological Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California-Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA.AbstractOBJECTIVE: To determine within a cat shelter effects of dietary lysine supplementation on nasal and ocular disease and detection of nucleic acids of Chlamydophila felis, feline calicivirus (FCV), and feline herpesvirus (FHV-1).ANIMALS: 261 adult cats.PROCEDURES: Cats were fed a diet containing 1.7% (basal diet; control cats) or 5.7% (supplemented diet; treated cats) lysine for 4 weeks.

There was no difference between dietary groups in the proportion of cats developing mild disease. However, more treated cats than control cats developed moderate to severe disease during week 4. During week 2, FHV-1 DNA was detected more commonly in swab specimens from treated versus control cats.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dietary lysine supplementation in the amount used in our study was not a successful means of controlling infectious upper respiratory disease within a cat shelter.

Animal shelters take several different approaches to prevent FHV-related upper respiratory infections (URIs), including empirically treating all cats with L-lysine, a supplement believed to prevent the replication of FHV and, therefore, manifestations of herpesvirus infections. In this study we tested oral supplementation of L-lysine as a means to prevent URIs. One hundred and forty-four cats were treated with L-lysine in a small amount of canned food once daily. A 'no treatment' group of 147 cats received no lysine during the course of the study. The development of conjunctivitis or URI was tracked between the two groups. In all measures, there was no effect between the two groups, suggesting that lysine was not able to prevent URI or conjunctivitis in our shelter situation. Cats entering shelters encounter stressors that may make them more susceptible to FHV reactivation or infection. Infection control and control of fomite transmission are also key to keeping cats healthy in a group housing situation.

A3OVECIE4PVUDF,"1-29-2014:I'm modifying this review and changing the stars from 4 to 5. I DID get my senior kitty to use it. It took a little more prompting. I had to both have her get used to a ramp from the couch to the floor (she gained confidence using that one, and eventually realized that there was a pretty similar ramp up to the Litter Robot), as well as change her alternate litter box to a cheap covered one - cost me $9.99 and is here on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ASCGC/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1. I kept it uncovered at first, then a few days later, covered it. I kept taping the lid of the covered one up (although it kept falling down). I think eventually the litter in there got dirty enough and the cover trapped in the smell enough that she saw the Litter Robot as a cleaner, better option. She and the younger cat have been fighting over the Litter Robot - the younger one got used to it being part of &#34;his&#34; turf. I did add more catnip to the litter (inside) as well as spray catnip spray around the 'bot, and used only Cat Attract litter for the 'bot (I used World's Best for the cheap covered box - which the Litter Robot people don't recommend using, btw.) For several days, I also put the globe on the floor. I stabilized it (somewhat) with the cardboard packaging material it came with (a few pieces had circles cut out which fit the globe). My senior kitty got used to using it while it was on the floor, and then I put it up on the base again, with the ramp, after she was already used to a similar ramp doing something she was motivated to do (getting on and off the couch). It's a bit of effort and can be a pain while transitioning, but it's very much worth the effort!!!I also called the people at Litter Robot and they gave me great advice. I thought my circuit board in the front wasn't working and they shipped another out right away (Murphy's law, it seemed to work again the day after I called them.) It really is an incredible piece of machinery and if you can't get your cat to use it, I'd try calling Litter Robot for a few other ideas...their ideas helped get me to get my senior kitty using it, and I am THRILLED.12-29-2014:The Litter Robot is the best kitty litter solution available, IF your cat will use it. We have two cats - one is a senior, arthritic with previous injuries, the other young and agile. The young one became curious enough and I let the other cat litter in the regular litter boxes &#34;go&#34; long enough for him to realize this was a good place to do his business. He doesn't, however, like it. It still intimidates him (after all, it does look like the Death Star - it's even intimidating looking for us). I added a makeshift ramp to it (a ramp catscratcher and put catnip on the catscratcher), to help entice him. It worked. I would recommend that the makers offer some kind of ramp like solution.My senior kitty would not use it. Even though she was embarrassed and ashamed, she preferred to go outside the traditional litter boxes (once they were dirty enough) than to use the Litter Robot. I thought the ramp would help entice her, but since it is lightweight and not attached, I think she felt too insecure using it. The shelf offered on this machine is not enough for the older, senior, arthritic cat. She is not very agile and, while not intimidated by the machine itself, she is intimidated by her ability to actually use it (get in, turn around, do her business, get out without falling, etc.). I really wanted her to use this since she has to go through radioactive iodine treatment soon, for her hyperthyroidism, and I wanted to limit my exposure to handling her radioactive waste, after the treatment. Since I've had it out for a month and she has never touched it, I gave up and bought the LitterMaid as an additional backup litter solution. The LitterMaid is pretty terrible. We've had it all of a night and already the litter is stuck on the rake and the rake is putting more clean litter than dirty into the waste receptacle.The two modifications I would make to the Litter Robot, if I were at all mechanically inclined would be:1. A ramp offering for cats who aren't agile (there's tons and the company would be wise to think of the owners of those animals - usually the seniors are using the litter box a lot more frequently, so owners have a greater need for some litter box help).2. A way to disengage the top. While my senior likes her privacy, and normally wouldn't have an issue with the top, she has been &#34;caught&#34; in a few places in the past, by the younger cat, and now doesn't like a spot that doesn't have an escape route. It's well known that cats are more comfortable with litter boxes with no covers. I know that if I had a ramp that was sturdy and didn't move, as well as a temporary period where I could take the top off, my senior cat would be using this as well.I'm keeping this as my younger cat *sometimes* uses it (he doesn't often - he'll use the alternatives if clean enough - he's still scared of the thing), so that helps. But it is a lot of money to shell out for a &#34;sometimes&#34;. I'm hoping that he gets more in the habit.If you have perfectly &#34;normal&#34; cats (I don't, both were rescues), then you'll probably have better luck than I've had. There is literally NO smell after the Robot has done its dirty work. You barely have to touch it (I only touch mine to turn the power on and off - so as to lessen the chances of freaking my cats out). And it doesn't spew litter everywhere, as one reviewer described. I do recommend spraying catnip spray on the outside, as well as adding some Cat Attract litter and catnip on the inside as well as on the lip and shelf. I also recommend purchasing a $16 incline cat scratcher ramp and sprinkling catnip all over that as well. It goes a little higher than the shelf, a little lower than the lip, but my younger cat has been using that.I also don't know what reviewers are complaining about as far as the noise goes. I live in a 750 sq foot house, with pergo floors, so ALL sounds travel, and I have sensitive hearing. I barely hear the litter robot from any other room. I guess any noise is too much for some people? It's not unbearable at all. Again, if this machine were modified, somewhat, for the older kitty or kitty with some body issues, it would be a home run. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is for that issue, otherwise it would be 10 stars.",A3OVECIE4PVUDF,"1-29-2014:I'm modifying this review and changing the stars from 4 to 5.

A21YHRL8I3TI7,"I never saw this before I saw it online while reading about nylabones for my 80 pound pup.  I liked the idea of pup being able to exercise large chewing muscles with minimal food rewards so I decided to give the Kong and Kong stuff'n snacks a try.  I purchased the peanut butter flavored snacks that can be stuffed part of the way into the opening of the Kong, to encourag!e nibbling. When pup has nibbled half of the snack, the remainder falls safely INSIDE of the Kong to rattle about enticingly as pup chases the bouncy toy and tries to slither a rather large tongue inside this seemingly indestructible dog toy!  Well worth the investment to buy the kong, and though I only bought the one flavor of snack initially, I will be purchasing more flavors in future.  I never give pup more than 2 or 3 snacks in the Kong and find this to be especially helpful in keeping the feeding schedule and training schedule unimpaired by the infusion of edibles throughout the day.  I did see that there is a paste that can be put inside the kong, but I believe the snack biscuits are better because there is no mess at all!

I purchased the peanut butter flavored snacks that can be stuffed part of the way into the opening of the Kong, to encourage nibbling. When pup has nibbled half of the snack, the remainder falls safely INSIDE of the Kong to rattle about enticingly as pup chases the bouncy toy and tries to slither a rather large tongue inside this seemingly indestructible dog toy!  Well worth the investment to buy the kong, and though I only bought the one flavor of snack initially, I will be purchasing more flavors in future.  I never give pup more than 2 or 3 snacks in the Kong and find this to be especially helpful in keeping the feeding schedule and training schedule unimpaired by the infusion of edibles throughout the day.  I did see that there is a paste that can be put inside the kong, but I believe the snack biscuits are better because there is no mess at all!"

A93LBTV617ZVC,"When I met my last rescue pet, Dixie, approximately 6.5 years ago, she was a real mess--both externally and internally.  She exhibited a nervous condition {G.E.R.D.} that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions; that is to say, that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up!  She was painfully emaciated, skeletal almost, and her blood-work was all over the place.  So, after a round of IV fluids and 2 bags of 'Science Diet' chow, Dixie came home with me to recuperate and to learn how to live in a loving home.  The first thing I did was to research which pet foods would address her particular condition; I knew that I didn't want to keep her on the 'Science Diet' regimen--it's too full of ingredients that I feel don't belong in a proper diet for dogs.  Lo' and behold, I stumbled upon the ""Nature's Variety Instinct"" formula for dogs.  It seemed like a good fit, due to all of the proper ratios {protein/fat} and totally 'GRAIN-FREE"".  Viola!  The rest, as they say, is history.... 6.5 years later, Dixie now weighs in at approximately 20 loving, happy pounds of my friendly and well-adjusted best friend.",A93LBTV617ZVC,"When I met my last rescue pet, Dixie, approximately 8.5 years ago, she was a real mess--both externally and internally.

A2E1KA7EK9YPB,"I purchased two bottles of the Feliway spray and one of the plug-in atomizers in the hopes that this stuff would stop my neutered male from peeing on my bed whenever he sees another cat or wildlife outside.  No luck.  It is possible that he was able to detect a urine smell on the blanket underneath the deflated air mattress I'd put on top of my bed to protect it, but I doubt it, since the blanket and sheets were laundered 3 times using Arm & Hammer/Oxy detergent and Febreeze for laundry, then dried with a dryer sheet.For others with this problem, I highly recommend buying a cheap, flocked-top inflatable bed and leaving on top of your bed deflated to protect the bed.  I use a Bissel Spot Bot (small carpet cleaning machine) with the upholstery attachment and hose to clean the air mattress when other cats or wildlife wander by.  It beats stripping the bed every time and is much less expensive and easier to clean than one of those crazy expensive waterproof pet blankets (the one big enough to actually protect my Queen size bed is far too big for my washing machine)!",A2E1KA7EK9YPB,"I purchased two bottles of the Feliway spray and one of the plug-in atomizers in the hopes that this stuff would stop my neutered male from peeing on my bed whenever he sees another cat or wildlife outside.

A9PZ8UY7EPS5V,"Decided to go raw almost a year ago after doing a lot of reading and research.  Started making my own dog meals which was time consuming and always wondering if I had all the right vitamins and minerals included.  I read a review on Paw Naturaw products which come frozen and my dog loved it.  For some reason they were discontinued and I tried Stella and Chewy's.  They are great products, I checked out the nutrition which is perfect and my small Pomeranian (16 lb) loves all the flavors which I rotate with each purchase. Being freeze-dried, they are easier to deliver than the frozen, easier to store and travel with. He doesn't like them re-hydrated, prefers them broken up in his dish dry.  They are a bit spendy; I wouldn't be able to keep a large dog on this diet.

AESUXU5AHWEFP,"This coat is nicer than shown in the photos. It has a warm, soft fleece lining, nice details, and is easy to get on and off as well as to adjust to my dogs. The Large fits my 45-lb Belgian shepherd (she's small for the breed). I need an extra large for my larger (65lb) Belgian. This fit for them is a little shorter than to the tail (they are a longer-bodied, less square breed) but the chest and belly straps fit them perfectly. If I had gone up a size for each of them so that the coat extended all the way to their tail, then the rest of the coat would have not fit properly.The girth (chest) strap on this adjusts from about 24"" to 28"" depending on how much you overlap the velcro. If you try to adjust up or down any more than that you could probably add or subtract a couple of inches but there won't be enough velcro contact to keep the strap closed on an active dog.Keeps them warm and it must be comfortable because they don't act as if anything is on them.",AESUXU5AHWEFP,"This coat is nicer than shown in the photos.

AGGAQLXPVGM5D,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE PETICURE POWER, PROFESSIONAL MODEL.I have a great dog with a good temperament.  However, to cut his nails and then spend a long time filing them takes a lot of time and patience on both the dog's and dog parent's part.Even with walking outside the nails are still sharp.  I saw an ad for the Pedipaws but searching on the internet, it was an offshoot from the Dremel and Peticure.Not having much experience with these devices, I compared the prices of the 3 models by Peticure.  There are three models: The Petite, Elite and Power.  The Petite and Elite come with 3 filing bands.  The Power which operates through a plug has 20 extra bands, is lighter and 2 times more powerful.  Given the fact that bands are $15 for 20, there is no reason to get nothing but the Power model (except for recharging capability).The 2 sheets that accompany the model are poorly written.  You have to refer to the company website to watch the videos on how to operate this.  Putting the thing together is not intuitive.  More explicit directions would have been better.You need to remove the plastic ring at the base of the head to attach the guard.  You push the lock button to untwist the mechanism to place the drum on the unit.The noise is a moderate pitched whirring sound.  My dog was not frightened by it.  There are preset ports that the nail is placed into.  Stabilize the pet's finger and use quick strokes to file the nail.  After some awkwardness of the operator, me, I got the hang of it.  There are videos on the website to direct you.  Dewclaws (at least on my dog's) were impossible to file.  The guard prevents but does not entirely eliminate the possibility of hair getting caught into the mechanism so be careful.After spending 3 times more effort assembling the unit versus actually using it, I was quite satisfied with it.If you are concerned about cutting your dog's nails but want something quicker to use, this is IT!

ACG6V7KFEAHHM,"I have two older cats (10+ years) and one had been throwing up every day which was very worrisome.  I was really afraid one of them was dying, but many comments said the vet had no idea what it was.  While trying to figure out what the problem was I stumbled upon all of the info on how bad most of the big brand dry cats food are and all of the nasty stuff that's in them - including euthanized animals (ew!).  Apparently, the best thing for cats is real meat but I have my cats on a timed feeder which is awesome and they don't hunt me down for every meal.  So, I compromised and switched to one feeding of wet (Friskies) and went looking for a good dry because I just can't commit to being stalked all the time when they want to be fed.

Anyway, the food is pretty big and ""X"" shaped which did concern me because my cats were used to much smaller bits.  They did transition to it well and the throwing up stopped immediately - and they rarely throw up at all now.

I was really afraid one of them was dying, but many comments said the vet had no idea what it was.  While trying to figure out what the problem was I stumbled upon all of the info on how bad most of the big brand dry cats food are and all of the nasty stuff that's in them - including euthanized animals (ew!).  Apparently, the best thing for cats is real meat but I have my cats on a timed feeder which is awesome and they don't hunt me down for every meal.  So, I compromised and switched to one feeding of wet (Friskies) and went looking for a good dry because I just can't commit to being stalked all the time when they want to be fed.

A2MKF2UM3Y8V5J,"This makes my dog itch. She rubs her face on the carpet a lot when she eats Pedigree puppy canned food. (I have never tried the dry.) I was buying wet food because I was having a difficult time giving her dry medicines in powdered form and I didn't want to give her peanut butter or sticky junk all the time. After we finish this off, I will not buy it again. I primarily feed her Taste of the Wild dry food which she thrives on. Pedigree Puppy makes her stools a funny, burnt color, and they smell awful, too. The vet says she is fine to finish it off, due to her minor reaction, so I am counting down the days. She actually prefers Taste of the Wild dry food, which I often keep in an Omega Paw food dispensing toy. When I put down her bowl of Pedigree, she will roll the toy on the floor hoping dry food will come out. Eventually she gives up and eats this... I have the chicken/beef flavor as well as this one.Update: My dog is now coughing a lot, to the point where I have thought, numerous times, that she had something stuck in her throat. Since nothing else she eats has changed, I am to assume that the more of this she eats, the worse she feels. She also has started to refuse to finish her food, and seems more... moody? Her stools are also progressively getting more inconsistent, despite giving her powdered enzymes as usual.I do not want to make it out to seem like I am against Pedigree pet foods, but there is an obvious, negative difference in my dog's health when she eats this.Though I don't have money to waste, I will be discontinuing this food.

A1V759M5PMHL3Q,"I bought this and the Ssscat Training Aid because I couldn't decide between the two.  They are very similar, they appear to have been produced in the same factory.  Stay Away is twice the price and the replacement canisters are more expensive.  The only difference I see is that Ssscat doesn't have a sound feature, it just sprays a blast of air.  I think I prefer that, although I can see the merit of the beeping sound, as pets will come to associate the beep with getting a blast of air, so the unit could be set to sound alone, saving the owner money on replacement canisters.I had my doubts about these, but they're totally worth it for the entertainment value alone.  I have a house full of cats that wait until we leave the kitchen to jump on the counter or in the sink.  It's VERY satisfying to hear the unit go off followed by the sound of a cat racing out of the room.Update November 2012: I bought a few each of Sscat and Stay Away and they all became unreliable within a few months and every single one of them broke completely in less than a year.  My original review gave this product 5 stars but I just knocked that down to 2 stars.  My cat situation is a bit desperate so I was going to buy a few more of these to keep my cats in line for at least a few months, but after doing some research on Amazon I opted for some scat training mats instead.

A3V0D97QKXDN5R,"I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in pt&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.What we're doing is based on the information provided by Lisa A. Pierson, DVM on Making Cat Food (catinfo.org) and she is of the opinion that cats need the bones which makes the grinding process more difficult. We still feed them some kibble because feeding 7 cats, plus some strays, gets pretty expensive. It's a shame packaging is getting smaller and prices do nothing but remain the same or go up. We purchase the Merrick and Wild Buffalo grain free dry foods and the bags are now down to 11 lbs. each. However, when doing the math the canned food is still less expensive per serving. Thanks for your comments.As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion.

I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.",A3V0D97QKXDN5R,"I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in pt&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand."

A38QVT40D0BA6M,"My dogs love these bones! I have an aggressive chewer & I always purchase Nylabone products for him. It's not as durable as a KONG, but instead of rubber, it's more of a plastic material. Be prepared, because it will splinter, if you have an aggressive chewer like mine, but it's definitely worth it because it keeps him entertained. I usually have one bone for 2-4 months, depending on his interest. You can even boil them in bouillon flavor once a week to keep the flavors strong!

I've never had a tank with water so clear. It's quite amazing. I have a fluval FX5 filter with the prefilter media and a bag of carbon on the top rack, 2nd shelf has 2 boxes of fluval bio media, and 3rd shelf has the filter floss with 2 boxes of biomedia. That's what it took to fill my filter. I found it was cheapest at the time on amazon. I have a 125g tank with a walleye and a couple dozen feeder fish (so a fairly messy bunch of fish).

A2I4JU06JM47LR,"I have tried my share of cat products with numerous cats that come to my home/rescue and this one is a miracle worker solving numerous issues with different cats. I have not had a cat react poorly to it and every one I have placed this product on, improved tremendously!Cat #1: Male Dominance: Classic case of a male wanting to dominate and peed occasionally on plastic items, such as bags, containers, etc. After placing the collar on him, he was cool and collected around all the other cats. The unwanted behavior ended and he seemed much more content with his surroundings. He even played and ate nicely with other cats around. Yeah!Cat #2: Obsessive Groomer- This one was female and had made herself bald in several areas from her nervous habit. I must say she is also a cat we could never get to wear a collar of ANY kind prior to this one. She took immediately to the collar and didn't mind it being on. It was very noticeable that she almost suddenly relaxed and spent time doing something else besides grooming. She was older, but we found her playing like a kitten again and enjoying toys we had for them. It is fantastic! Slowly but surely her fur is growing back!Cat #3: Nervous wreck/Hider: When the weather turned badly and I was unable to get home for 3 days, the cat I call ""my shadow"" was missing in action when I returned. It took me forever to find her smushed under a bedroom dresser where she would only come out to potty. She even stopped eating! I wasn't sure what had affected her so badly to suddenly change a very social cat in such this way, but I knew she needed help. I tried several things such as reassuring her back in her favorite spots, hand-feeding her and calling the vet desperate for a solution. Here it is! This collar worked instantly on her and she loved the ""flakes"" on her skin. Immediately, she was talking, lounging in her favorite spot and being my shadow. I am simply thrilled with this product!Cat #4: New Yongster in Town: While I have a rescue, there are two resident cats that are considerably older and the new kitten was a little more than they wanted to deal with. I put a collar on him as well and it ""settled"" him a bit, making him less annoying to all of us! It didn't alter his cuteness or general level of play, but it kept him from pestering.While I have used this product with GREAT SUCCESS, I will say, yes, the powder does go everywhere when you first put it on, but that is nothing compared to the benefits you and your feline receive. It is also not an easy to break away collar, but my feline friends are indoors and I keep my eyes on them. I think this works much better than the diffuser overall because it is on them. It is not intended to get wet, so remove it if/when you bathe your cat or I'd take it off if they go outside since it will lose its potency if it gets weathered. If you are having indoor behavior issues, I think this item works better than Prozac and other prescription products. Not everyone in the house has to wear one to benefit from it.

A1361FYA7V4J6A,"For years I have had a cat that would go to the bathroom in numerous places, most of them not in his box. Suitcases, area rugs and bathmats, plastic or bubble wrap, nylon fabric, athletic shoes and flip flops were his favorite things to pee on. A few years ago we rescued two kittens and his issues got even worse. He hated sharing any of the three boxes we have and didn't even like using ""his"" box when he had already used it once before. I just couldn't clean the boxes out frequently enough, especially when I wasn't home. He also started pooping on the floor beside the litter box. This was an almost daily occurence. Over the years I have tried several of the eco-friendly litters. Feline Pine eventually made my house smell like a damp wood shop, scattered everywhere, and sometimes I would get a splinter in my foot from it. World's Best is corn based and smelled like a farm and my cats hated it. Swheat Scoop was OK -- until I got a few bags infested with moths. I was desperate to find a new litter, even it wasn't environmentally the best choice. I just wanted something that all my cats would use and controlled odors without an overwhelming perfumed scent. Last week I bought two bags of Precious Cat and replaced all the litter with it. I know it's best to introduce a new litter gradually, but I decided it was do or die time, so to speak. They all seemed very interested at first and just started by smelling. Over the next 24 hours they all began testing it out. It has now been one week and I am thrilled to report there has not been a single accident or present left outside the box! This morning I even discovered the old cat using one of the boxes normally used by the other cats. I have never seen him use it before, and it had been used several times before he hopped into it. That is just unbelievable after all these years and problems. Life has gotten a lot easier for all of us thanks to Precious Cat! It is worth the price!!!Update 11/11/11: The success has continued to be impressive overall. I have been buying this locally at Petco for $21.99. Stopped in Petsmart today and discovered they are selling it for $14.99 a bag! Guess where I am shopping from now on?! Petsmart does sell a stainless steel litter box, if you are looking for something besides plastic. It has a modern look, very high sides, rubber feet and is $24.99. They also sell the herbal mix that you can sprinkle in, I got some to add in for boost of encouragement. We had a minor relapse recently with our old cat when house guests disrupted his routine. I am hoping that the stainless steel litter box, the herbal mix and some coaxing will get him back on track. Even with his current issue, he is still using the box more frequently thanhe ever did before I switched to Precious Cat. It has really made a huge difference for our household.I would like to address a few comments left by other reviewers. I was skeptical about the dustless claims. I am sure there is some dust eventually, but I haven't seen it. No dust cloud when you pour or sift through the box. I completely agree with comments about the smell of the litter. There is virtually no smell to the litter itself, other than a faint herb smell that is almost undetectable unless I am inches from it. Odor control of cat waste is excellent, especially if the waste is covered by the cat. Tracking is minimal and stays close to the box. I used to find Feline Pine and Swheat Scoop on my couch, in my bed, everywhere. Precious Cat clumps very hard, but the longer it sits the better. One of my cats pees in a line pattern, so his clumps break up more than the others. And sometimes it does stick to the box. However, if I tip the box and gently bang on the outside of it, the clump will disloge without breaking and I can easily scoop it up. There is no such thing as perfect, but this litter is a lifesaver for our household.",A1361FYA7V4J6A,"For years I have had a cat that would go to the bathroom in numerous places, most of them not in his box.

AK0CENM3LUM28,"I recently bought and/or received three cat fountains for my two kitties (senior adult; ~15 pounds each). This will be a review in three parts, as I feel the fountains are best reviewed in comparison to each other.---Hagen Catit Design Fresh and Clear Cat Drinking Fountain/ B004L4XR3I (2 Stars)The Hagen Catit fountain was such a disappointment to me, because I love the clean modern look of the Hagen Catit products and I love the ""expandability"" of the products they have for sale -- it seems like all their products have some optional add-ons that stroke my ""buy gifts for kitty!"" impulses. Unfortunately, the Hagen fountain I received was super loud and the plug-in was worrisomely hot to the touch. It was quiet from the time we plugged in the unit until the next evening, at which point it had escalated to a dull roar that could be heard from the other side of the house. Cleaning the filter and unit didn't affect the noise, and when we unplugged the unit to clean it, we realized that the power source was burning hot to the touch. I think we received a faulty unit. Probably the company (or Amazon) would have sent out a replacement unit, but I didn't want to try again because the cats didn't seem to care for the ""bubble-up"" nature of this particular water fountain.---Drinkwell Rectangle Multi-Level Plastic Fountain Drinking Dish/ B0056ASTES (3 Stars) [This is the product page you're currently on.]This was my second Drinkwell fountain, received free through Vine after my first one broke. This is a different model and I don't think I like it very much. For myself, I found it difficult to put together -- the unit has to be compressed with your hands and snapped in and out of place, and I found this very difficult to accomplished. (Note: I am a person with a disability. Your mileage may vary.) And this unit, while not as loud as the Hagen, was still plenty noisy -- about an hour after plugging in the fountain in the kitchen, I realized I could hear it humming from the bedroom. I'm very sensitive to electronic noise, and so I didn't care for how loud the unit was in our home. I will say that our cats liked this one just fine, and were not put off by the form factor or the sound (although they were already used to our last Drinkwell, which was far from silent), so I will keep this one for use on our outdoor patio.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.---Pioneer Pet Stainless Steel Fountain Raindrop Design/ B0037NKDSG (4 Stars)This is the fountain we ended up keeping for use in the kitchen. I really like the teardrop shape, and the cats took to the fountain with no issues. I like that they can drink from the fountain or from the relatively-still ""pool"" that collects to the side. Best of all, while the unit isn't noiseless, it's definitely the quietest drinking fountain we've owned -- there's very little electronic hum, and it's largely drowned out by the normal splashing fountain sounds. I also like that the unit is super easy to dissemble and clean -- I can clean this fountain by myself in five minutes flat, with no snapping parts to wrestle into place. The only potential downside that I can see is that a really energetic dog or kitten might be able to shift the parts, but my cats are quiet senior adults and don't try to play in the fountain. I will also note that I like the shiny silver surface, but it seems to be losing a lot of luster in the short time since we've had it. So it's not perfect, but it meets our needs.~ Ana Mardoll",AK0CENM3LUM28,"I recently bought and/or received three cat fountains for my two kitties (senior adult; ~15 pounds each).

But if you use a little creativity, you can give your dog something he can work on for quite some time.With the Star Pod, I put treats in to plug all the wholes (Whole Life Tail Mix Meatballs are great for this). Then I pour a yogurt mix (I usually use yogurt, wheat germ, and cheese or fruit) in or smear peanut butter or applesauce and freeze it.My Australian Kelpie is very industrious and usually finishes a treat toy in minutes.

A17EXZEX71ZTMU,"My vet prescribed this for my dog's yeast infection. Then for the cat later.  It is very easy to use - just squirt a good amount into the ear canal, massage the base of the ear to get it all the way down and your done. It specifies not to clean the ear and let it do its work.  The hard part is holding the animal down for the treatment.  I even used it on a little infection in my own ears and it cleaned it up pronto.  The yeast never develop resistance to this like it does to the fungicides because it is enzymatic. This revolutionizes the ear infection treatment for pets.The ear cleaner has the same enzymes as the medicine. The medicine has a little hydrocortizone to cut the itching from the infection.",A17EXZEX71ZTMU,"My vet prescribed this for my dog's yeast infection. Then for the cat later.

ABQVDKWU40G0V,"Feliway Comfort Zone diffusers are great for reducing stress in cats. They help prevent aggression and urine marking in the home. But, they are really expensive- $15-18 per monthly refill. I had the brilliant idea to use a $5 appliance timer (electric socket timer from Home Depot) to reduce the amount of Feliway dispensed by the Diffuser. To ensure the Diffuser is releasing product frequently, I use a timer that allows for 15 minute intervals and set it to supply electricity 1/3 of the time (ie on for 15 minutes off for 30 minutes). The timer makes the product last 3 times as long so it pays for itself in less than a month. Feel free to experiment with the timing.  Perhaps you can get away with having it on for just 15-30 minutes 3 times a day, it will depend on your cat's level of stress. I would start with it being on 1/2 of the time and gradually decrease the time as kitty feels better. I hope this tip will help people to keep their beloved kitties and help kitties heal from the issues that lead them to tinkle in the house.

AXYZO5MK2X9H0,"I have two Bengals and one of them really stresses out when we go on vacation.  Before Feliway, our cat would pee on piles of paper and/or clothing left out while we were away.

We have two litter boxes for two cats who are codependent sisters that show no aggression towards one another (so her accidents were not dominance/territory issues).When we returned, there would be tons of LOUD night howling.

A3V0D97QKXDN5R,"I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.We had a cat develop some urinary problems: bladder stones which restricted her ability to urinate and caused some bleeding and she was trying to urinate all day long to help relieve the irritation. The Vet claimed it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food that causes the stones because the cat can't process enough liquid to handle the food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet dry special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit and chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meat varieties in pt&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is more, but urinates fewer times, now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food. In general, the cats prefer a dry food that's fish flavored.What we're doing is based on the information provided by Lisa A. Pierson, DVM on Making Cat Food (catinfo.org) and she is of the opinion that cats need the bones which makes the grinding process more difficult. We still feed them some kibble because feeding 7 cats, plus some strays, gets pretty expensive. It's a shame packaging is getting smaller and prices do nothing but remain the same or go up. We purchase the Merrick and Wild Buffalo grain free dry foods and the bags are now down to 11 lbs. each. However, when doing the math the canned food is still less expensive per serving.As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We had Subscribe & Save on some other brands but they disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand. As an example, I was paying about 8 bucks for Friskies canned food in the 5.5 ounce 24-pack and it's now a little over 16 bucks so if you see some deals on this savings program buy a lot of it or keep an item in your cart to see if the price drops and then subscribe... you'll be guaranteed that price for the first month delivery. If it continues... and the price continues to rise we'll stop buying them and even with 15% off and free shipping they cost more than at the food store... about 10 bucks for a 24-pack is pretty much what we pay at the food store though we will pay a bit more just to have it come in a case... end of price increase rant!Update 1/17/14: As expected, Amazon just raised the price... though it's only 50 cents it will likely go up more. So I checked the list of other sellers and found PetFoodDirect had it for on sale (27.79) and after checking their Website I found they also had free shipping so I purchased 2 more bags. If how much you pay is important then check prices before buying... even though I didn't.",A3V0D97QKXDN5R,"I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it.

We purchase the Merrick and Wild Buffalo grain free dry foods and the bags are now down to 11 lbs. each. However, when doing the math the canned food is still less expensive per serving.As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand. As an example, I paid just under 24 bucks for this on 6/12/2013 with 15% off on Subscribe & Save and today's price, with that same discount, is a little over 32 bucks and I can now kick myself for not buying a half dozen bags. I was also paying about 9 bucks for Friskies canned food in the 5.5 ounce 24-pack and it's now a little over 16 bucks so if you see some deals on this savings program buy a lot of it or keep an item in your cart to see if the price drops and then subscribe... you'll be guaranteed that price for the first month delivery. If it continues... and the price continues to rise we'll stop buying them and even with 15% off and free shipping they cost more than at the food store... about 10 bucks for a 24-pack is pretty much what we pay at the food store though we will pay a bit more just to have it come in a case... end of price increase rant!"
A3V0D97QKXDN5R,"I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.We had a cat develop some urinary problems: bladder stones which restricted her ability to urinate and caused some bleeding and she was trying to urinate all day long to help relieve the irritation. The Vet claimed it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food that causes the stones because the cat can't process enough liquid to handle the food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet dry special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit and chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meat varieties in pt&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is more, but urinates fewer times, now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra.

I was also paying about 9 bucks for Friskies canned food in the 5.5 ounce 24-pack and it's now a little over 16 bucks so if you see some deals on this savings program buy a lot of it or keep an item in your cart to see if the price drops and then subscribe... you'll be guaranteed that price for the first month delivery. If it continues... and the price continues to rise we'll stop buying them and even with 15% off and free shipping they cost more than at the food store... about 10 bucks for a 24-pack is pretty much what we pay at the food store though we will pay a bit more just to have it come in a case... end of price increase rant!",A3V0D97QKXDN5R,"I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.We had a cat develop some urinary problems: bladder stones which restricted her ability to urinate and caused some bleeding and she was trying to urinate all day long to help relieve the irritation. The Vet claimed it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food that causes the stones because the cat can't process enough liquid to handle the food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet dry special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit and chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meat varieties in pt&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is more, but urinates fewer times, now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food. In general, the cats prefer a dry food that's fish flavored.What we're doing is based on the information provided by Lisa A. Pierson, DVM on Making Cat Food (catinfo.org) and she is of the opinion that cats need the bones which makes the grinding process more difficult. We still feed them some kibble because feeding 7 cats, plus some strays, gets pretty expensive. It's a shame packaging is getting smaller and prices do nothing but remain the same or go up. We purchase the Merrick and Wild Buffalo grain free dry foods and the bags are now down to 11 lbs. each. However, when doing the math the canned food is still less expensive per serving.As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly.

A1P02FVX8QJOES,"I have three dogs, ranging in size from a 12 lb terrier mix to a 17 lb poodle mix. We have three interactive toys, this one, the Seek-A-Treat wheel puzzle and the Zanies interactive pizza puzzle. Some people may prefer plastic, or not find this puzzle durable depending on the size of their dog.  ALWAYS supervise your dog with any toy, especially ones with moving parts like these.  I personally prefer the wood for a couple reasons:1)Fear that plastic would soon get sharp-edged grooves from bite marks.2)The idea of my dogs chewing on plastic in general.3)Wood just seems more durable in my case.4)It makes me nervous knowing how my dogs chew on the puzzle sometimes that they might break their teeth or break off a piece of sharp plastic and swallow it.However, I will admit that this wood is more difficult to clean than plastic would be.I've had this puzzle for several months now, and rotate it between dogs almost daily - one is an aggressive chewer and clawer, one is very good at circling the puzzle until she figures out what to do, and the third just kind of plunks along til something moves. It hardly has a scratch on it at this point in time.To make the game more challenging, I roll up a piece of junk mail until it's stiff and insert it between the sliders, to make it harder to get the treats out. Keeps my dogs occupied for maybe 20 minutes or longer, depending on the dog and their skill level with extracting the paper wedges (it's definitely time to get a couple more puzzles to keep them guessing!). Overall, I was very happy with this purchase, as were my dogs!",A1P02FVX8QJOES,"I have three dogs, ranging in size from a 12 lb terrier mix to a 17 lb poodle mix.

A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,"Aquarium filters remove many harmful chemicals, but nitrates do accumulate over time, and the way to remove them is by periodic partial water changes, usually something like 20% per week. The old way was to siphon water out into a bucket, which was dumped down the sink, commode, or in the yard. The bucket was then refilled and poured back into the tank.To change water in this manner was a little bit labor intensive on a small tank, and really time consuming on a larger tank.I stumbled on my pump in a Thrift store, where I found it on a shelf for $1. In all honesty, I'm not 100% sure mine is a Python brand, as there is no name on it. It may actually be a knock-off. Mine is made of blue plastic, not green, but otherwise looks identical to the item pictured.It operates by connecting it to a water supply with a fitting at the top in the photo. Water flows through from top to bottom, past a venturi located where the side fitting is, creating a suction which will draw water out of the aquarium through a hose. I purchased 50 feet of clear vinyl hose from my local aquarium store, attached it to this device, and put a suction strainer on the other end to avoid sucking small fish into the hose.In use, I drop the suction strainer into the tank, unroll the hose, and attach the pump to the water tap outside my front door. Opening the diverter on the pump outlet, then turning on the water tap starts a siphon which removes as much water from my tank as I desire (water tap can be closed once siphon starts so long as the pump is lower than the tank, siphon will continue).Closing the diverter on the pump outlet stops the siphon, and opening the water tap with the diverter closed refills the tank.I can't imagine any way to make water changes any easier. I've been using this device for years now, and it still works great.There are adapters available which allow the user to connect the pump to their kitchen or washroom sink instead of outside the house, if the aquarium is located closer to those water sources. There are also attachments which allow you to vacuum the gravel with the water siphoning out of the tank, if you feel the need to perform this task (I never vacuum because I don't use an undergravel filter, because I use EcoComplete substrate, and because I have fish which eat any food which falls to the bottom, so for me, the need simply isn't there).",A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,"Aquarium filters remove many harmful chemicals, but nitrates do accumulate over time, and the way to remove them is by periodic partial water changes, usually something like 20% per week.

ACJT8MUC0LRF0,"One of the first things I noticed about the Allmax Puppy Training Pads, is that they are much wider than the 17"" x 24"" (43.18cm x 60.96cm) pads that I currently use.  At 22"" x 23"" (56cm x 58cm),  I certainly appreciate the added width because my Liam can be a traveling dog at times and I have to keep a roll of paper towels and a disinfectant spray nearby.  Liam is a small dog and the reason I use these pads is that during the winter months he's unable to go out because of the heavy snows and ice that come down from the roof.  The usual ""generic"" pads I use are relatively inexpensive and are, in reality, chucks for medical use. They work fine for very small dogs, but are really not meant for puppy training like the Allmax are.Don't try to economize and purchase the ""generic"" pads if you have a dog who is over ten pounds or a puppy who will outgrow them quickly.  Believe me, you'll be spending more time cleaning up a big mess and scolding yourself wasting money rather than saving it.  Liam, who enjoys marking his territory (we have another dog in the house), has had no problem switching to the Allmax.  And with the added width he's not missing his mark.

AS3UM0LHN7L1Y,"NaturVet Digestive Enzymes with Prebiotics & Probiotics is a wonderful product that I regularly give to my four dogs (2 Dachshunds, a Chihuahua and a French Bulldog). I feel that it plays a very important role in their having a healthy digestive tract, and especially my longhaired Dachshund who was prone to stomach upset and loose stools. We tried gradually changing her to different dog food brands to no avail. The problem was only remedied when we started her on NaturVet Digestive Enzymes with Prebiotics & Probiotics. If you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or loose stools you definitely should give this a try. It works wonders!I like that NaturVet Digestive Enzymes with Prebiotics & Probiotics:1) Aids in digestion of food and absorption of nutrients.2) Makes my dogs stool firm.3) Decreases their gassiness (which is a big deal for our bulldog).4) Strengthens their immune system, and slows the growth of disease-causing bacteria.5) Contains prebiotics to feed the probiotics (good bacteria) supercharging them.6) And I like knowing that it is made in the USA.It can be sprinkled on a small amount of dry or wet food (to make sure all of it is eaten), stirred in, and is readily consumed by all four of my dogs. If you are feeding dry food, add a small amount of room temperature bottled spring water to it before sprinkling the product on (chlorinated tap water will kill the probiotics). I find that it sticks to moistened dry food and is better consumed that way. After they have eaten the small portion of food containing the NaturVet enzymes/probiotics you can give them the rest of their food.HOW IT WORKS:Your pet's digestive tract normally contains billions of bacteria and micro-organisms that assist with digestion. It requires a healthy balance of friendly and unfriendly bacteria. Poor diet, antibiotics, prolonged illness and aging can deplete the beneficial bacteria faster than they can be replenished. An incorrect balance of unhealthy bacteria over desirable bacteria is associated with poor digestion, inadequate Vitamin B12 absorption, systemic yeast infections and autoimmune diseases.Your pet may also be deficient in digestive enzymes because the organs that make them produce less and less as your pet ages and also because most of the enzymes normally found in foods are lost when the foods are cooked and processed. Enzyme deficiencies cause gas, constipation, diarrhea, skin rashes, bloating, gastric upset and lowered immune function.The prebiotics in NaturVet Digestive Enzymes with Prebiotics & Probiotics feed the probiotics (good bacteria) supercharging them so that they can restore the proper bacterial balance and fight the growth of disease-causing bacteria and yeast. And the enzymes help break down food so that it can be easily absorbed by the body ensuring your dog or cat is getting the nutrients they need.PLEASE NOTE that if, when your pet begins taking probiotics, they initially experience gas or diarrhea these can actually be signs that the probiotics are working and that harmful bacteria and yeast are dying and being eliminated from your pet's body along with other wastes and toxins.

NOTE: NaturVet Digestive Enzymes with Prebiotics & Probiotics is meant for intermittent use.A 4 oz container lasts a 50 lb dog 56 days when used at the recommended dosage.STORAGE: Probiotics are living organisms, and are perishable. It is best to keep Probiotics refrigerated and away from exposure to high heat and humidity. Probiotics can, however, be maintained at room temperature for several weeks with a minimal loss of 5% or less. Always put the lid back on tightly.",AS3UM0LHN7L1Y,"NaturVet Digestive Enzymes with Prebiotics & Probiotics is a wonderful product that I regularly give to my four dogs (2 Dachshunds, a Chihuahua and a French Bulldog). I feel that it plays a very important role in their having a healthy digestive tract, and especially my longhaired Dachshund who was prone to stomach upset and loose stools. We tried gradually changing her to different dog food brands to no avail. The problem was only remedied when we started her on NaturVet Digestive Enzymes with Prebiotics & Probiotics. If you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or loose stools you definitely should give this a try. It works wonders!I like that NaturVet Digestive Enzymes with Prebiotics & Probiotics:1) Aids in digestion of food and absorption of nutrients.2) Makes my dogs stool firm.3) Decreases their gassiness (which is a big deal for our bulldog).4) Strengthens their immune system, and slows the growth of disease-causing bacteria.5) Contains prebiotics to feed the probiotics (good bacteria) supercharging them.6) And I like knowing that it is made in the USA.It can be sprinkled on a small amount of dry or wet food (to make sure all of it is eaten), stirred in, and is readily consumed by all four of my dogs. If you are feeding dry food, add a small amount of room temperature bottled spring water to it before sprinkling the product on (chlorinated tap water will kill the probiotics). I find that it sticks to moistened dry food and is better consumed that way. After they have eaten the small portion of food containing the NaturVet enzymes/probiotics you can give them the rest of their food.HOW IT WORKS:Your pet's digestive tract normally contains billions of bacteria and micro-organisms that assist with digestion. It requires a healthy balance of friendly and unfriendly bacteria. Poor diet, antibiotics, prolonged illness and aging can deplete the beneficial bacteria faster than they can be replenished. An incorrect balance of unhealthy bacteria over desirable bacteria is associated with poor digestion, inadequate Vitamin B12 absorption, systemic yeast infections and autoimmune diseases.Your pet may also be deficient in digestive enzymes because the organs that make them produce less and less as your pet ages and also because most of the enzymes normally found in foods are lost when the foods are cooked and processed. Enzyme deficiencies cause gas, constipation, diarrhea, skin rashes, bloating, gastric upset and lowered immune function.The prebiotics in NaturVet Digestive Enzymes with Prebiotics & Probiotics feed the probiotics (good bacteria) supercharging them so that they can restore the proper bacterial balance and fight the growth of disease-causing bacteria. And the enzymes help break down food so that it can be easily absorbed by the body ensuring your dog or cat is getting the nutrients they need.PLEASE NOTE that if, when your pet begins taking probiotics, they initially experience gas or diarrhea these can actually be signs that the probiotics are working and that harmful bacteria and yeast are dying and being eliminated from your pet's body along with other wastes and toxins.

A33AQPJYH7UUXR,"This mat rates five stars because it helps me maintain a little better control over two uber-smart pets. I own four of these mats in total, in three of the different sizes. I consider it a training AID and a tool that gives me a few extra seconds to help my pet when it needs a reminder of what the rules are and sometimes a few seconds is all you really need.First, I am new to being a cat-mom and the lengths that a young cat will go to in testing and RE-TESTing its boundaries will probably never cease to amaze me. At 11 weeks it was the war of chewing cords; I used the ScatMat in a hallway to keep him on one end of the home while I kitten-proofed all the cords on the other end then switched. At 15 weeks he became nimble enough to jump up on the kitchen counters in one leap. Butt surfing on my formica and eating out of the sink are two things I'd rather he not have as habits. Also, if he could reach the counter that meant the stove COULD be next! This counter size ScatMat was ordered the next day as well as a special cover for the stove.The cat, btw, has since decided that the ScatMat will NOT Have the last word on where he should be allowed to roam; the little guy spends a decent amount of time EVERY day sitting near the patio door in front of the mat, walking around the mat, crouching ever-so-near the mat, and appears to be intensely engrossed in figuring out how to outsmart the mat! So far, the mat is winning but with this amount of intense daily contemplation I wouldn't bet against the cat.My dog, a 15lb doxie-poodle mix has always been well behaved and I have no need for the ScatMat as far as he is concerned. I did have to place a mat in front of a patio door to keep the kitten inside the house though and the dog quickly and easily figured out that he needs to approach it from the side and just leap over the corner. If you are buying this to keep a small dog contained I should mention that I did not work long and hard on training my dog to outsmart the mat, I just put on his leash and said, ""let's go"" as I always do when it's potty time and he navigated right around it and followed me out the door. I don't know for certain if he has ever activated the mat since he walks very quickly and the mat needs a second or two with two contact points to trigger the response. He does seem to know there's something to be a little wary of with the ScatMat; he avoids it, so it's possible his curiosity got the best of him when I wasn't looking. Point being, it is very easy for my little guy to get around or over the mat.In the end, this mat helps me to keep the kitten off surfaces in the kitchen and helps keeps him indoors where he should be.

A3TP31S61PPE3G,"Frankly my Genny is very picky with her food. She doesn't like much - including table food. Oddly the only food she really goes for big time is usually fresh bugs of the crunchy kind. Yuck!I got two different types of Nutrience Food. When I opened the other bag and filled her dish she did the usual search and sniff and pawing around it. I'm never sure what that is about but she's done it since was a kitten. However what I've never seen her do is DIG IN like the food was going to vanish right away. My Genny is 12 and has always been a &#34;grazer&#34; eater - meaning she eats a little bit quite a lot during the day. I do not think I have ever seen her eat a bowl of cat food. Until now. I put about 3/4 cup in the dish and she ate it. ALL.OF.IT. Then she licked her chops, drank a bunch of water and contentedly went and sat on her Cat Fusion Scratcher thingy. She's just never done that. This was followed the next morning by active meowing until such a time as I fed her and she repeated this behavior.I thought surely it could not happen with BOTH types...because experience has taught me that picky girl likes one thing at a time. But when this type was put down she had the same reaction. She seems to like both equally.As I noted in my other review of the other flavor - She's toned down a bit - and will eat about 1/2 of what I put in the bowl now at a month in or so. Her fur looks great (no more of the dry fur issue by her tail that caused little white flakes with our other cat food), she has not gained weight but has not lost (that's perfect), and she has thrown up once. As a reference the cat food she's been on for years was making her throw up about 2x per day (so now you know why I wanted to try something new!)I'm just completely sold on this. I'm not a connoisseur of cat food - but this looks like it has excellent ingredients. It seems a bit more &#34;meaty&#34; or heavy than other cat foods. It doesn't feel as airy. I guess that's good. It also doesn't make her breath stink like one of the other one's we tried. I've only used high quality food like Iams and Science Diet so it's not like I give her generic food or anything.Both this and the other flavor are the best foods we've ever used for our girl. Love the velcro in the bag. I think this would be the perfect size for a multi cat household as well. Very strongly recommended.

In the past, my cats would mostly ignore any toy I bought (even catnip ones!), well except for the string with feathers on it... they destroyed the feathers within a evening then ignored it.  They instead opted to play with my skeins of yarn (I'm a knitter) and a little lamb stuffed ornament that we have lying around the house.  I had my doubts, but after their enjoyment of catching live rodents at my parents house this past summer, I thought maybe a toy that made noise would attract them.  So far, it has done the trick!  My yarn is no longer being unwound during the middle of the night or when we leave them during the day!So, it works and they love it... but what about the sound?  At times it can be a little annoying (early morning/late at night if it wakes you), but after a few days I have gotten more used to it.  It is a high pitch noise, I liken it to one of the birds by our house yet similar to a rodent.

They instead opted to play with my skeins of yarn (I'm a knitter) and a little lamb stuffed ornament that we have lying around the house.  I had my doubts, but after their enjoyment of catching live rodents at my parents house this past summer, I thought maybe a toy that made noise would attract them.  So far, it has done the trick!  My yarn is no longer being unwound during the middle of the night or when we leave them during the day!So, it works and they love it... but what about the sound?  At times it can be a little annoying (early morning/late at night if it wakes you), but after a few days I have gotten more used to it.  It is a high pitch noise, I liken it to one of the birds by our house yet similar to a rodent.  We can hear it upstairs when they are downstairs in our open floor plan house.Side Note:  I had for some reason expected the squirrel to be a bit bigger; it is about the same size as the mice."

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. At least there is turkey in it, but other than that its all nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Other Friskies flavors are even worse than this one. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.",AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials.

Highly recommend!"
A1PAWNVNIGBCZT,"I have written reviews of other Cosmic Catnip filled toys, so I am sorry if I am repeating myself. These toys are absolutely fantastic! If your cat(s) like catnip, they will LOVE these toys. I find the cigar and banana to be the favorites. The carrot is fine, but I am not comfortable with feathers around my cats - particularly when catnip is involved. I think it is too easy for them to swallow a piece of feather and have it lodge in their throat.... just my personal fear! However, every single Cosmic Catnip toy I bring in the house is a huge hit. They are slobbered over, rubbed on, laid on, sat on, etc. until they are an unsightly mess - and the cats STILL love them!",A1PAWNVNIGBCZT,"I have written reviews of other Cosmic Catnip filled toys, so I am sorry if I am repeating myself.

A1A1BM6N28X9J0,"I can't comment on the health aspect as it is for things you can't see with the naked eye but my cats sure are loving the flavor so I know they will eat it all and get the nutrients that are in it. I do notice that their fur is nicer, more silky and soft than when they aren't eating Science diet and they seem to eat a bit less as well as not potty so often. They also don't spit up when they are eating this hairball formula. Just wish I could find this brand around here and wish it wasn't so expensive. I have to go 80 miles to the nearest place that sells it. Not even the vets around this area sell it. Ordering it online is even more expensive so looks like when I can get it through Vine my cats will have it, otherwise it's back to Iams, Purina or Friskies as I can get those at any Wal-Mart store.",A1A1BM6N28X9J0,"I can't comment on the health aspect as it is for things you can't see with the naked eye but my cats sure are loving the flavor so I know they will eat it all and get the nutrients that are in it.

A34EQAIKKUWYYW,"I have been keeping planted tanks for a long time. I recently set up a DIY CO2 generator for my tank and had used Fluval's diffuser in the past in a similar setup. I ordered another for my latest planted tank and the bubble counter for ease of use.You do not need to have commercial tanks of CO2, a fancy regulator, or an expensive setup in order to have lush CO2-assisted growth. I use an old Gatorade bottle, some black airline tubing, Fluval's diffuser, and this bubble counter. I wasn't going to get a bubble counter but it was so cheap on Amazon that I went ahead and ordered it, and I am glad that I did! It provides another piece of equipment that prevents the tank from leaking back out the tubing onto the floor and allows you to see if your generator is still producing gas.For a DIY CO2 generator:1. Gatorade or other thick plastic bottle. Many people recommend 2-Liters. I think these are too big.2. Fleischmann's Active Yeast, or some other baker's yeast. Not the Fast Rise kind3. Airline tubing. CO2 tubing is really expensive and since you are generating your own CO2 for pennies, don't worry too much about gas escaping.4. Check valve. Very important.5. Plastic inline connectors for tubing6. Bubble Counter7. Diffuser8. Silicone (if needed)Drill hole in lid of plastic bottle. Affix plastic inline connector INSIDE the bottle with one side pointing down into the bottle and the other pointing up out of the lid. (if necessary, you can use silicone to get an airtight seal) Attach a small length of airline tubing inside the bottle. This length should be short enough that it will not dip into the Yeast and sugar mixture in the bottle. Affix another piece of airline tubing to the connector poking out of the lid. This goes to the bubble counter. Place the check valve between the counter and the diffuser.The bubble counter will allow you to count Bubbles Per Second for your tank. (Various plants require different levels of CO2 in the water and are almost always measured in this BPS count.) It should have about an inch of water in it and be attached to the exterior of the tank. As gas is pushed into the counter, you will see a bubble form from the stem inside. It will pop and the gas will float to the airspace above the water level, and after enough pressure is built up, will begin pushing gas into the tank via the diffuser.For this bubble counter, make sure that the intake and output valves are screwed as tightly as possible. I found a gas leak on the intake because I didn't have the tubing pushed down far enough on the stem.The diffuser should go in the tank in a location that will provide for the maximum transfer of CO2 gas with the water. In my tank, I have attached it directly underneath the intake for my Fluval 305 filter. The CO2 goes into the filter, slowing through the media for a longer time of gas exchange, then hits the impeller as it is pushed back into the tank. You do not want to put the diffuser near the surface or around an airstone. In fact, you don't want to use an airstone for oxygen in the tank during your photoperiod. Oxygen bubblers cause CO2 to not be in the tank long enough to have a good gas exchange. (I use an air pump at night to make sure that oxygen levels to not drop dangerously while the lights are off and photosynthesis has stopped for the day. I turn off the pump about an hour before the lights to come on to allow CO2 to build back up in the tank and be readily available to the plants when the lights come back on) If you do not wish to have your CO2 go through your filter, put it in an area as close to the bottom of the tank as possible, with as little water movement as possible. You can hide the diffuser anywhere if you are using a bubble counter because you will still be able to tell if the generator is producing gas by looking at the bubble counter.In the bottle, mix warm water with sugar, swirl it around until the sugar dissolves, then add the baker's yeast. The amount of sugar and yeast that you use will determine how long the generator stays charged. I have had bottles last two weeks, and I have had bottles last two days. Basically, you want there to be enough sugar to feed the yeast as it reproduces. More sugar means longer CO2 production. Keep in mind that a whole packet of yeast will be waaaaaaaaaaaay too much and may cause your bottle to burst.After putting the lid with its attached line back on the bottle, walk away. It takes time for the yeast to produce enough gas to provide sufficient pressure. You will be tempted to open it. Don't. If after three hours there are still no bubbles coming through the diffuser, one of four things has happened:1. You have a leak in your system (fruit flies and/or the smell of rising bread will tell you this)2. You did not use enough yeast, your yeast was not active, or your water was too cold3. You are impatient and still need to wait4. You have water in your system and you will have to wait for internal pressure inside your bottle to overcome the water pressure from your tank (this is why I recommend the check valve)",A34EQAIKKUWYYW,"I have been keeping planted tanks for a long time.

What it does is use pressure to force CO2 gas through a microporous stone disc into very small bubbles. The smaller the bubbles are, the longer it takes for them to reach the surface, and the more gas exchange can occur. A regular airstone really won't cut it."

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance.

I have seen them both start to have tartar when I was less scheduled about given them sticks daily, and I've watched it recede when I got back on the ball. this product works.Way too long version:I worked as a veterinary technician for 10 years, and I gave hundreds of clients &#34;the talk&#34; about the importance of oral hygiene. I've personally performed dentistry services on dogs and cats (including scaling, polishing, and tartar removal where it was literally cracking chunks of tartar off teeth). Taking care of your pets' teeth is important. it makes them healthier and happier, and helps to prevent one route for heart disease, kidney disease, and general infection.I've tried lots of things to take care of my dogs' teeth; the dentastix are the last on the list:tooth brushing:I started with straight up tooth-brushing. That was a failure. my spaniel HATED mint-flavored pastes, and would get all trembly all over any time she smelled it. she LOVED the meat-flavored options, and so we'd spend the time having a wrestling match while she tried to lick the paste and eat the brush i was trying to use. I gave up.Dentabones:These were the precursors to dentastix. larger, and SUPER effective. the spaniel got one 1-2x a week, and it kept her tartar at bay. I check her over pretty regularly, and if I missed a week or 2 (or 3) of dentabones, i'd see the tartar creeping up.t/d:this is a Hills prescription food targeted for tartar control. I never used it for meals, but I'd get a bag through work and give the kibbles as treats. The kibbles are large and designed to be too large to swallow whole, forcing the dog to crunch them. The spaniel will eat near anything (but mint toothpaste- see above); while she wasn't terribly enthusiastic about t/d, she ate them. I didn't use them for long, though, because while the spaniel would grudgingly crunch through while giving me spaniel-eyes, my german shepherd took the &#34;too large to swallow&#34; size as a challenge. i was a bit nervous about this causing problems down the road, from either choking, or bloat. also, it doesn't do much good for the teeth if not crunched.C.E.T.s:these are the raw hide-type treats you can get at your vet's. they're treated with some enzyme or other to help break down tartar. These are supposed to be more digestible than other rawhides, so you have less concern about rawhides blocking up the GI tract. These work moderately well, and both dogs were relatively big fans. For a chewer, they'll last a decent amount of time, and my spaniel was a fan. I stopped using these for a couple of reasons. 1- once again, the german shepherd wanted to swallow his whole and quickly so he could steal the spaniel's. 2- they're a little pricey for daily use. 3- the biggest reason was that my spaniel was a little too into savoring them. she'd chew and suck and tug on them, and they become long and slimey and gross. inevitably, she'd start sucking on one she had tugged out to be long and it would lodge halfway down her throat and half way still in her mouth, making her gag and me have to reach in and pull it out. once or twice, fine, but she started doing this every time. too risky for me.NUBZ:these are the treats for teeth sold at Costco that are shaped vaguely like a bone/toothbrush. the dogs both love them, and in a flavor test (holding one in each hand and letting the dog choose- and my dogs do sniff back and forth), prefer them to dentastix. Unfortunately for them, these just don't seem to keep the tartar at bay. they slow it for sure, but not to the degree i've seen in the dentastix.Kirkland Dental Chews:These are the x-shaped treats also sold at costco. I never used these long enough to she a tartar effect because my spaniel had an allergic reaction to some ingredient and got itchy and pink all over.Dentastix:I resisted dentastix because I thought it was just a scheme to sell smaller dentabones for more money or something. I think it ends up coming to be only slightly more expensive to do dentastix once daily v. dentabones once weekly. or it did, before the dentabones were discontinued. I've had great success with dentastix. the one time my vet noted there was some beginning tartar build up, I really knuckled down on remembering to give dentastix regularly, and the tartar completely receded. i haven't had any allergy issues i had with the kirkland line, it's more effective than nubz, and cheaper than CETs (with less choking hazard). I think these are a GREAT addition to your regular doggie care.The only caveat i have is that there still is a bit of a choking hazard. My german shepherd was eating one and got too big a piece lodged in his teeth. Apparently (as told by my husband) he started freaking out, frothing, slamming his head about and pawing like mad. My husband actually though the dog was having a seizure. before calling me in a panic though, he investigated the situation a little closer and found the big chunk (like, 3 inches long) that was causing the freak out. he pulled it out, and all returned to normal. This is the only time something has happened like this and they've been getting the dentastix daily for 3 years.

A3JHC8O59WDHFZ,"I admit, one of the reasons i buy this kitten food is that it's relatively cheap. Not dirt cheap, which is good, because i don't entirely trust the people who can make kitten food so inexpensively. What're they putting in there?Anyway, it's pretty cheap as kitten food goes. It also doesn't smell awful, a problem i've had with some other wet pet foods, but it is a little stinkier than the chicken and liver food from the same company. The kittens devour it, which is also good.But best of all, it doesn't upset their tummies, so i don't have to clean up nasty messes.",A3JHC8O59WDHFZ,"I admit, one of the reasons i buy this kitten food is that it's relatively cheap.

A2QXKX3GST6BBJ,"I ONLY use Epi Soothe products on my Westie. I mostly use the Shampoo, conditioner, and ResiCORT leave in conditioner and sometimes the Humilac spray. Westies are HIGH maintenance dogs and I recommend Virbac products highly. I bathe her with Epi Soothe shampoo once or twice a week. I put on the Epi Soothe cream rinse too (you can leave this in if you like but I rinse it off her). I towel dry her and then put on pretty thick layer of Resicort especially around her feet and her vulva (her feet and vulva are discolored from her licking). Putting Resicort on these areas has reduced chewing by at least 50% - 70% and her feet are almost completely white like they should be.",A2QXKX3GST6BBJ,"I ONLY use Epi Soothe products on my Westie.

A2VXKD4NN8J7B9,"This Product is AMAZING!!!Within weeks (maybe even days) my dogs coats were softer and more beautiful. My oldest dog has allergy issues and it has helped calm her allergy/inflammation issues so she rarely has to take medicine anymore. This is a wonder product. I have 2 boxers and I give them each 2 pumps twice a day on the top of their food. It may seem pricey but it actually lasts way longer than products you buy at the pet store because you use less of it. One 33 oz bottle with 2 dogs lasts well over a month. Maybe even 2 months. I have been using the product for 4 months and just started my 3rd bottle. In that time I have given it twice daily to my 2 dogs, and twice daily to foster dogs that have lived with me off and on.  Also, it is free of the additives that a lot of brands have. This is a great product, my dogs love it and it has been great for their skin/coat/allergy issues!!! They recommend that you switch every other bottle between Anchovy and Salmon so that is what I have been doing.",A2VXKD4NN8J7B9,"This Product is AMAZING!!!Within weeks (maybe even days) my dogs coats were softer and more beautiful.

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.This is an A-Grade food.

A1ITRGMT80D5TK,"When I got these treats I was unaware of all the controversy surrounding them and the whole China made dog treats.  I did a bit of research and although I see that these are ""Made in the USA"", I also came across some info that says just because they are made here doesn't mean the ingredients come from here.  So, I became pretty nervous about giving these products to my dog.  To me, it's not worth the risk, regardless of how much the company wants to say that it's perfectly safe.  I love my dogs dearly so I'll stick to what we've used for years that I know they're okay with.I did give my dog one of these prior to researching them.

A12B7ZMXFI6IXY,"I have two dogs and both are *EXTREMELY* finicky eaters when it comes to dog food.  Even since they were puppies, I made sure they got the best food available.  But for some reason, they wouldn't eat it like other dogs do (scarf it down).  I tried all kinds of top brands ranging from various brands of Innova, Orijen, Acana, Blue Wilderness (Blue Buffalo), Fromm, and Merrick.

A3L61G6N7AT8N2,"I have a pet saber tooth tiger that loves tasty snacks like bones, meat chunks, cow gristle, etc. I was looking for something that would take time for him to chew. The Mammoth Bone is perfect, since the woolly Mammoth is a natural prey of a saber tooth tiger.I wouldn't say it's ""Meaty"" since a bone by definition has no meat. I guess the brown part of it is some type of ligament or chunks of skin that didn't get pulled off in the factory. It's costly to get a bone really clean unless you use hydraulic acid, but then, it wouldn't be ""100% Natural"" and it'd probably be very dangerous for animals or termites to eat.I've tried the bone a few times, it has a zesty flavor to it, sort of like it was barbecued on an open pit flame and doused with vinegar and pork grinds.I don't think if your dog is a vegetarian, that he would like this because it comes from some animal part I'm guessing. Which part, I don't yet know. Also, there's no instructions, so if you have small Weiner dogs, you might want to grind this up before giving it to them since it can crush their aorta.",AI0NMYA3LKXW1,"I have a pet saber tooth tiger that loves tasty snacks like bones, meat chunks, cow gristle, etc.  I was looking for something that would take time for him to chew.

A1S3DCJ9T7GAK,"As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those ""duh"" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of ""treat.""  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it ""makes pills a treat to give!""The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger ""capsule"" dog Pill Pockets.The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost.

(Yes, I tried glass, ceramic, stainless steel, every recommendation about what type of bowls cats are said to prefer...)When the cat water fountains first came out I was skeptical at first...but it made sense, obviously this re-created what the cats preferred. The running water, the sound....so I got one.The critical element after buying the fountain is maintaining it. READ the directions! Change the filters ""every 2-4 weeks depending on the size and number of pets using the fountain"". Thats from the back of the Drinkwell filter package. And please use Drinkwell filters if you have a Drinkwell fountain! They are made to work together.Also, read the directions as far as maintaining the Drinkwell (or any brand) of water fountain. It has a motor!  Therefore, it must be maintained or will not work right.  Maintaining it means keeping it clean from the residue of hard water chemicals, the animal's food (which can drop into the water after they eat, then go round the circle of the water cycle...) and so on.CLEAN the fountain...including the little parts around the motor. We take it apart about every other week and put the entire fountain, minus motor, in the upper section of the dishwasher, and run it, with the usual dishwashing detergent, which works great. The motor area can be cleaned with q-tips or the special brushes sold by Drinkwell. If the fountain is not kept clean and the fiilters are not replaced, the whole thing will stop working, though long before that your cats will be drinking recycled dirty water.This isn't hard, just a bit of reminding yourself, or marking on a calendar.  Just like with your car, there is basic cleaning and maintenance required.From reading some other posters: please don't use BLEACH to clean the fountain...plastic of all kind (think Tupperware) absorbs odors, I can't imagine a cat with his/her sensitive nose drinking water after the unit was cleaned w/ bleach, no matter how dilute. Also the vinegar and water thing....thats better than bleach but are you really cleaning the unit? Not that it has to be sterilized....just cleansed the way you would your family's dishes and glasses.  Handwashing in warm sudsy water with a good rinse will be fine, too.  Just read what it says about the motor part, and follow the directions.It is absolutely NOT difficult to keep clean and maintain.  And the cats are definitely drinking more.  Both prefer to drink from the fountain part, as it comes out from the top, as opposed to drinking from the ""pool"" of water at the bottom, which would be, after all, no different than drinking out of a bowl of water.Highly recommend!  It should help the health and longevity of the cats, especially when used as it is meant to be."
A3SLENWVD7CEQ9,"A day or two after I placed my order, I got an email from the company asking me to contact them. I sent an email telling them which tags I wanted and received a prompt reply. The tags arrived today, way ahead of the projected scheduleI've never seen a nicer pet tag.  The seller has a nice selection of graphics to choose from.  This is a nice, thick, heavy tag, with more heft than any I've ever seen before..  The engraving on these tags appears to be quite deep and so will last a long time.  However, my pets only wear one tag because I don't like the jangle of multiple tags, so it would be unlikely to wear off anyway like some of the thin old tags I have seen on other pets.

A2YZBIF2WXNHJD,I have two healthy indoor rabbits.  Alfalfa free pellets made of Timothy hay is the best for bunnies.  Most pellet food out there has alfalfa in it or is made only with alfalfa!  That is crazy because its not good for your bunnies especially adult bunnies!  This is mostly the crap you will find on store shelves of popular pet store chains!  This one by Kaytee is great and Oxbow Bene Terra organic is a good one as well.  Sometimes there are farms out there too that sell alfalfa free pellets as well.  If your bunny's poop is soft and extra stinky you are feeding to many veggies and not enough Timothy hay and Timothy based pellets like these.  Remember that carrots are actually high in sugar so do not feed them daily to your bunny.  Green carrot tops are a healthier option as well as a dark lettuce.  I still only feed those a few times a week.  Their primary diet should be Timothy hay and Timothy pellets if you want a healthy bunny with firm little poop pellets!,A2YZBIF2WXNHJD,I have two healthy indoor rabbits.

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet.

Every product I have found has"" Made in China"" in small print somewhere at the bottom of the package. I don't think using pet treats from China is a good idea right now... I have been researching companies and this is what I found from The Real Meat Co. sales dept:The Real Meat Company products are made in the USA and meats sourced from USA, New Zealand and Australia.1. The meat in our products is sourced from only the finest farms, free ranging and humanely raised without growth hormones or antibiotics and our fish are from the deep clear oceans of the South Pacific.2. There are NO ingredients from china.3. We do not use any grains and have no wheat or gluten.4. No preservatives, no anti-biotic, no flavorings, no growth hormones, no colorings.5. It is not irradiated.6. Every shipment of meat carries USDA, FDA certification. (believe it, they check all small companies)7. They're YUMMY! HEALTHY!

A11PJ95XN3WKGY,My cats like it and I purchased it with the 50oz additional reservoir. I had previously killed two fountains (burnt out the pumps) from different manufacturers because I could not easily see if they needed water. The reservoir is easy to see and even easier to fill with ice and water. It was simple to put together and can be serviced without difficulty. Good investment. I have added the filters to my Prime subscriptions as a reminder.,A11PJ95XN3WKGY,My cats like it and I purchased it with the 50oz additional reservoir.

A1GARI2JT6EAWA,I have no idea if this dog food is as good for my dog as the bag promises. I know from my experiences growing up out in the country that dogs are not nearly as picky about what they eat as their owners (or &#34;pet parents&#34; as one commercial calls them) are. All I know is that my dog loves it (but then again she loves most anything she eats) and the bag tells me that it is better for her than most of the dog food that you can buy in your grocery store.,A1GARI2JT6EAWA,I have no idea if this dog food is as good for my dog as the bag promises.

A3OC93X866Z8TB,"I could jump up and down and scream----I have FINALLY found something that eliminates odor.  Yes, you heard me ELIMINATES it.  It's gone, gone, no more smell.  I have tried everything out there.  Sprays, vinegar, you name it, I have tried it (my cat is a repeat offender).  So when I watched ""My Cat From Hell"", and Jackson recommended this, I thought ""what do I have to lose"".  If I could give this 10 stars, I would!I didn't honestly believe this would eliminate it, as I have tried every so-called eliminator, and nothing has worked.  I used it on 3 spots, 2 of which were minor and one that was bad.  My cat got a urinary infection, so she peed on the floor.  The urine was a stronger smell than usual because of her infection.  The 2 spots were probably only 1 time offenses, but the stronger spot was most likely several repeat urinations in that same area.  I tried 2 different products on all spots, and the smell still lingered.  The bad spot was still very strong.  I then tried this exactly as the directions say, and the 2 minor spots are gone, completely gone.  The bad spot took several treatments.  I have aBISSELL Little Green Multi-Purpose Compact Deep Cleaner, 1400-7, so I saturated the area with the cleaner in the spray bottle and let is set for about 30 minutes.  I then sucked the cleaner up with my Bissell, and repeated the process.  The smell was gone in the entire strip of carpet, except for a lingering of it in one small area.  You have to get down into the carpet with your nose to smell the lingering scent.  I believe that with continued treatment, I can eliminate the entire odor completely.This set comes with an empty bottle (which is what I understood when I read the description of the product, so I wasn't surprised when it came empty) and 2 tablets.  I'm glad I bought this set, because the spray bottle is a nice one, that sprays even when it is at an angle.  I will be buying a bulk pack of these things now.  I'm so excited I might wet myself!

AS3UM0LHN7L1Y,"Columbia Laboratories Pyrantel Pamoate 50 mg to 1 ml Suspension works wonderfully for the removal of large roundworms (Toxocara canis and Toxascaris leonina) and hookworms (Ancylostoma caninum and Uncinaria stenocephala) in dogs and puppies. I have used it for over 20 years for my own puppies and dogs.It is MUCH cheaper than the monthly treatment packs with 2 chewable tablets (with 113.5 mg pyrantel pamoate per tablet for a total of 227 mg of pyrantel pamoate per pack) marketed for dogs that will cost you anywhere from 5 to 10 dollars each. This 32 oz bottle of Columbia Laboratories Pyrantel Pamoate 50 mg to 1 ml Suspension contains 48,000 mg of pyrantel pamoate, the equivalent of about 211 of those 2 chewable tablet treatment packs. It would cost between $1055 to $2110 depending on the brand you purchase to get the same amount of doses with those 2 tablet packs that you get for around $30 with this 32 oz bottle of Columbia Laboratories Pyrantel Pamoate 50 mg to 1 ml Suspension.DIRECTIONS FOR USE WITH DOGS: Can be given directly to your pet or mixed with food. Shake bottle before each use, this is extremely important because this is a suspension and the active ingredient will settle at the bottom of the bottle. For puppies: Administer at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of age. Treat mother at the same time. For adults: First initial worming: give one dose followed by another dose 2 weeks later. Thereafter, give one monthly dose.DOSAGE FOR DOGS: Measuring with an oral medication syringe, Give 1/10 (one tenth) of 1 cc for each 2 lbs of body weight OR give*One teaspoon (5 cc) for a 100 lb dog*One half of a teaspoon for a 50 lb dog*One fourth of a teaspoon for a 25 lb dog*One eighth of a teaspoon for a 12 lb dogNOTE: If worms are resistant, the above dosage can be doubled. The dosing information listed above is for 2.5 mg of Pyrantel Pamoate per pound (this Pyrantel Pamoate suspension is 50 mg to 1 mL (1 mL = 1 cc) so 1 cc will treat 20 lbs, 5 cc's will treat 100 lbs, and every 1/10 of 1 cc will treat 2 lbs). Pyrantel Pamoate is usually administered at either 2.5 mg per pound, or, in cases where worms are resistant, 5 mg per pound.OVERDOSAGE: Pyrantel Pamoate has a moderate margin of safety. Doses approximately 7 times the recommended 2.5 mg per pound generally have not resulted in toxic reactions. Signs of an overdose could include panting, staggering, or loss of balance. Contact a veterinarian immediately should you notice any of these signs or in cases of accidental overdose.SHELF LIFE - This product has a shelf life of 3 years stored at controlled room temperature. I wouldn't give it after the expiration date on the bottle as it would be less effective, although not harmful, because according to a Material Safety Data Sheet for Pyrantel Pamoate, products of degradation are less toxic than the product itself.COST-EFFECTIVENESS: With one 32 oz - $30 bottle with a 3 year shelf life you can worm up to 6 large dogs for 3 years. If you only have one dog, you can give one dog 36 monthly doses costing you about 83 cents per dose, even with unused product; for 2 dogs 36 monthly doses would cost about 42 cents per dose, even with unused product; for 3 dogs 36 monthly doses would cost about 28 cents per dose, even with unused product; for 4 dogs 36 monthly doses would cost about 21 cents per dose, even with unused product, etc.Even if you receive a bottle that only has one year of its 3 year shelf life left, you can still worm up to 18 large dogs for one year. If you only have one dog, you can give one dog 12 monthly doses for a cost of about $2.50 per dose, even with unused product; for 2 dogs 12 monthly doses would cost about $1.25 per dose, even with unused product; for 3 dogs 12 monthly doses would cost about 83 cents per dose, even with unused product; for 4 dogs 12 monthly doses would cost about 63 cents per dose, even with unused product, etc.",AS3UM0LHN7L1Y,"Columbia Laboratories Pyrantel Pamoate 50 mg to 1 ml Suspension works wonderfully for the removal of large roundworms (Toxocara canis and Toxascaris leonina) and hookworms (Ancylostoma caninum and Uncinaria stenocephala) in dogs and puppies.

If you have only one dog, you can give one dog 36 monthly doses costing you about 55 cents per dose, even with unused product; for 2 dogs 36 monthly doses would cost about 27 cents per dose, even with unused product; for 3 dogs 36 monthly doses would cost about 18 cents per dose.Even if you receive a bottle that only has one year of its 3 year shelf life left, you can still worm up to 9 large dogs for 1 year. If you have only one dog, you can give one dog 12 monthly doses for a cost of about $1.67 per dose, even with unused product; for 2 dogs 12 monthly doses would cost about 83 cents per dose, even with unused product; for 3 dogs 12 monthly doses would cost about 57 cents per dose, even with unused product; for 4 dogs 12 monthly doses would cost about 48 cents per dose, even with unused product, etc.",AS3UM0LHN7L1Y,"Columbia Laboratories Pyrantel Pamoate 50 mg to 1 ml Suspension works wonderfully for the removal of large roundworms (Toxocara canis and Toxascaris leonina) and hookworms (Ancylostoma caninum and Uncinaria stenocephala) in dogs and puppies. I have used it for over 20 years for my own puppies and dogs.It is MUCH cheaper than the monthly treatment packs with 2 chewable tablets (with 113.5 mg pyrantel pamoate per tablet for a total of 227 mg of pyrantel pamoate per pack) marketed for dogs that will cost you anywhere from 5 to 10 dollars each. This 16 oz bottle of Columbia Laboratories Pyrantel Pamoate 50 mg to 1 ml Suspension contains 24,000 mg of pyrantel pamoate, the equivalent of about 105 of those 2 chewable tablet treatment packs. It would cost between $525 to $1050 depending on the brand you purchase to get the same amount of doses with those 2 tablet packs that you get for around $20 with this 16 oz bottle of Columbia Laboratories Pyrantel Pamoate 50 mg to 1 ml Suspension.DIRECTIONS FOR USE WITH DOGS: Can be given directly to your pet or mixed with food. Shake bottle before each use, this is extremely important because this is a suspension and the active ingredient will settle at the bottom of the bottle. For puppies: Administer at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of age. Treat mother at the same time. For adults: First initial worming: give one dose followed by another dose 2 weeks later. Thereafter, give one monthly dose.DOSAGE FOR DOGS: Measuring with an oral medication syringe, Give 1/10 (one tenth) of 1 cc for each 2 lbs of body weight OR give*One teaspoon (5 cc) for a 100 lb dog*One half of a teaspoon for a 50 lb dog*One fourth of a teaspoon for a 25 lb dog*One eighth of a teaspoon for a 12 lb dogNOTE: If worms are resistant, the above dosage can be doubled. The dosing information listed above is for 2.5 mg of Pyrantel Pamoate per pound (this Pyrantel Pamoate suspension is 50 mg to 1 mL (1 mL = 1 cc) so 1 cc will treat 20 lbs, 5 cc's will treat 100 lbs, and every 1/10 of 1 cc will treat 2 lbs). Pyrantel Pamoate is usually administered at either 2.5 mg per pound, or, in cases where worms are resistant, 5 mg per pound.OVERDOSAGE: Pyrantel Pamoate has a moderate margin of safety. Doses approximately 7 times the recommended 2.5 mg per pound generally have not resulted in toxic reactions. Signs of an overdose could include panting, staggering, or loss of balance. Contact a veterinarian immediately should you notice any of these signs or in cases of accidental overdose.SHELF LIFE - This product has a shelf life of 3 years stored at controlled room temperature.

A39SKV601VBNXI,"I've been feeding Soft and Chewy Buddy Biscuits to my three dogs for years. They're great because they break apart easily, so you can give them whole or break them down for training or to fit appropriately in interactive toys.Some dogs may not be thrilled about the lamb flavor as much as other Buddy Biscuit flavors (our three dogs seem to favor the Beef and Grilled Chicken), but I've never seen a happy dog turn them down.I note these as a ""mid-value"" treat because I've tried using these as a high value treat for a fearful dog, and they just didn't cut it. It's not surprising, as high value usually needs to be something like cheese or meat, but I did want to make the distinction.That doesn't mean they wouldn't be high value for your dog (every dog is different), but they do not work for us.They are not ""mid-value"" as in quality. They are high quality treats, with good ingredients, made in the United States. We currently buy every flavor we can on Amazon through Subscribe and Save, if that says anything about how we feel about them.Out of all of the flavors, our dogs like the Sweet Potato and Peanut Butter flavors the least.

A3GGXJD0BMJ2W3,"This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.",A3GGXJD0BMJ2W3,"SO WORTH IT.

A3FS3FJPD3RJTD,"I got all three of the Nyantomo litter boxes. This is the middle one--larger than theNyantomo Purr Fect Potty Starter Kit for Kittens, but without the top of theNyantomo Purr Fect Potty Hooded Box Starter Kit.

I don't think that would mess up the system.  This box uses two pads, instead of one, like the kitten box.  The kitten box isn't really that small, so most adult cats I know would have no qualms about using that one, too, if you want to go smaller and cheaper.  With all three Nyantomo boxes, there is no tracking, no dust and no odor.  There's also much less litter needed, so much less weight involved.

A3KE6TMMH3BG00,"Like most other reviewers, PRECIOUS CAT ULTRA PREMIUM CLUMPING CAT LITTER gets five stars from me.  After years of using regular, non-clumping clay litter preferred by three older indoor/outdoor cats, I got tired of constantly hauling it from the store for my current brood, three young indoor-only cats.  I decided to start trying clumping litters and PRECIOUS CAT ULTRA PREMIUM CLUMPING CAT LITTER was the second brand I tested.  I love it, and the cats prefer it, too.Pros-  No dust!-  HARD clumping.  The first clumping litter I tried created fragile clumps that tended to break apart when I shook the scooper to separate the clump from the clean litter.  Although I haven't tried it, I think I could play stickball with these clumps.  :-)-  The litter is unscented (I hate the perfume-y smell of some clumping litters), but does a great job of controlling odor with my one-scoop-per-day habit.-  Minimal tracking.  This was a problem with the first clumping litter I tried.  The cats tracked it all over the house.  With this litter, the ""grains"" are heavy enough that they tend not to cling to cat fur.-  The cats love it.  I had one box with this litter sitting next to a box with the non-clumping litter for over a month.  The cats began using this litter more and more and the non-clumping litter less and less.  By the end of the day, the PRECIOUS box would be too full of waste while the non-clumping litter was barely used.  Even though I wasn't quite finished with the last bag of non-clumping litter, I got rid of it and put this litter in both boxes.  From day one, the cats began to use both boxes equally.Cons-  For me, the only con is the packaging.  A 40-pound bag of this litter is actually smaller than the 25-pound bag of non-clumping litter I used, and it lasts much longer.

It's definitely not a deal-breaker, and in fact, the litter's density is probably responsible for its hard-clumping, non-tracking traits.  It's just something to note.Second time's a charm, and my clumping litter tests are over.  I found a clumping litter I can live with!",A3KE6TMMH3BG00,"Like most other reviewers, PRECIOUS CAT ULTRA PREMIUM CLUMPING CAT LITTER gets five stars from me. After years of using regular, non-clumping clay litter preferred by three older indoor/outdoor cats, I got tired of constantly hauling it from the store for my current brood, three young indoor-only cats. I decided to start trying clumping litters and PRECIOUS CAT ULTRA PREMIUM CLUMPING CAT LITTER was the second brand I tested. I love it, and the cats prefer it, too.Pros- No dust!- HARD clumping. The first clumping litter I tried created fragile clumps that tended to break apart when I shook the scooper to separate the clump from the clean litter. Although I haven't tried it, I think I could play stickball with these clumps. :-)- The litter is unscented (I hate the perfume-y smell of some clumping litters), but does a great job of controlling odor with my one-scoop-per-day habit.- Minimal tracking. This was a problem with the first clumping litter I tried. The cats tracked it all over the house. With this litter, the ""grains"" are heavy enough that they tend not to cling to cat fur.- The cats love it. I had one box with this litter sitting next to a box with the non-clumping litter for over a month. The cats began using this litter more and more and the non-clumping litter less and less. By the end of the day, the PRECIOUS box would be too full of waste while the non-clumping litter was barely used. Even though I wasn't quite finished with the last bag of non-clumping litter, I got rid of it and put this litter in both boxes. From day one, the cats began to use both boxes equally.Cons- For me, the only con is the packaging. A 40-pound bag of this litter is actually smaller than the 25-pound bag of non-clumping litter I used, and it lasts much longer. But it is difficult for me to carry from the store to the car to the house. The slick plastic bag the litter comes packaged in doesn't help. I don't want to pay the high shipping charges for this product, and I can't find the smaller 18-pound unit at the store.

The Wolf size is really too small for Large dogs. These were offered via Amazon's add on program so I grabbed a few but this size is really only ideal for smaller dogs. We ended up letting our boys chew them under supervision and they went at them without mercy and each shew session lasts a good hour which is saying quite a lot as their average attention span with most toys is about 15 minutes.

AS3UM0LHN7L1Y,"Greenies Feline Pill Pockets are not only great for cats, they are safe to dogs, too. The makers of Greenies Pill Pockets say the only difference in the dog and cat formulas is that the pill pockets for cats have extra taurine. This is because a cat's liver has a limited ability to make taurine and also because cats lose taurine in the secretion of bile acids. It was thought that dogs don't need supplemental taurine because they can make taurine out of vitamin B and the amino acids methionine and cysteine, however, dogs are often deficient in taurine and routine supplementation is not harmful. In fact, new studies have shown that extra taurine is imperative for Cardiovascular Health in dogs. It was found that dogs with clinical signs of Dilated Cardiomyopathy (a.k.a. DCM, one of the most commonly acquired cardiovascular diseases in dogs) had low plasma taurine levels. Although the prognosis for dogs with this disease is not good, some did survive with care and supplemental taurine.I routinely give pill pockets for cats to my Chihuahua when administering medications. He likes both the salmon and chicken flavors. Cat pill pockets are half the size of the small pill pockets for dogs, but they are just the right size for my Chihuahua and, I am sure, other small and toy breeds, to eat without chewing (and no chewing means they don't discover the pill inside). They are cheaper by the bag than the small ones for dogs and you get 15 more pill pockets per bag (45 per bag in the cat formula versus 30 in the dog). But because pill pockets are so pliable, you could pinch the small dog pill pockets in half and they would cover 60 pills, 15 more than a bag of cat pill pockets. But, for me, it is more convenient and faster when preparing his medications to buy the cat pill pockets that are already the right size, plus I like the benefits of the added taurine.",AS3UM0LHN7L1Y,"Greenies Feline Pill Pockets are not only great for cats, they are safe to dogs, too.

However for something that does not smell, clumps without being gooey, and economical this is it.I have a bin with wheels and have two bags full in it most of the time. I roll it to the cat box. After cleaning out the clumps I can just scoop in the fresh stuff.I have to confess to periodical tossing the whole contents of the box out and taking a garden hose to it then a handy wipe. One cat moves the new fill out of the way and looks up as if to say he knows I am just being cheep at his expense.There is minimal dust. However I keep most of the boxes in the garage with a cat door; so a quick sweep and we are clean with no dust in the house. I do keep one box in the bath room for when the cats play ""kill the first thing through the cat door"".

ANUUF3N6B9NTA,"I have purchased several varieties of Cesar Canine Cuisine. I have purchased the expensive meaty variety and the aspic type. Individually, they range in price between $.75-$2.00 for a 3.5 oz. container.I typically pay approximately $10 for a 12 pack of 3.5 oz. servings = a total of 42 oz.

ABL3PCYAQ1Y4C,"I ordered both salmon (usually my cat's favorite flavor) and beef (she usually doesn't care for beef flavoring, in fact has digestion troubles with it sometimes).  The first I tried was Salmon flavored:  I felt very sure that my slim, persnickety, Persian diva would leave these where they lay; for sure when they were delivered right after I served her a fresh serving of Friskies canned Salmon shreds.  Now, to serve her a daily dose of powdered medication, I have to mix a small amount of the powder with moist, canned food; which is why I even give her moist food.  She would smell or taste the medicine and not touch it if it wasn't mixed right, and she would eat right around it.  So, for her to eat these, I was quite pleased.  They are small, about the size of a piece of puffed wheat; and very hard and crunchy; I can hear her crunching from ten feet away.The ingredients list corn flour, chcken meal, wheat flour and corn gluten meal as the first of many listed. The label say's ""with nutritious vitamins & minerals plus the essential amino acid taurine"" and ""under 2 calories per treat"".  The calorie count at the bottom notes 1.1 calorie per treat.  Label advertises that the product ""removes 3 times more tartar than regular cat treats"", and includes an ingredient called Denta Shield, which supposedly creates a shield to prohibit further tartar build up.  The consumer has no way of verifying this of course, but I will assume that if this is even half true, and she is getting half the vitamins, it is better than nothing.  If she won't eat it, it won't do her any good.Now, the second time I fed her today, I offered her three more treats, and she declined to eat them, so appetite appears to have some affect on her desire to eat them.",ABL3PCYAQ1Y4C,"I ordered both salmon (usually my cat's favorite flavor) and beef (she usually doesn't care for beef flavoring, in fact has digestion troubles with it sometimes).

A3B83GRTAX6QOM,"I have a 10 year old Beagle who is a ""walking garbage can"". I like to say that he will eat anything that ""is or ever was food"" if you know what I mean. No matter what I do, he will eat anything. As a result, he gets terrible diarrhea and occassional vomiting. Since it doesn't go away on its own, I end up having to take him to the Emergency vet frequently, to be given fluids and anti-diarrheic meds (like Metronidazole which he has taken many times). This has happened multiple times while away on vacation, requiring for me to end my vacation early which was not ideal for both my dog and myself.While at the vet one visit, my Vet suggested that we try this product - Forti Flora for dogs. I purchased one box from my vet to try it out. One box is a 30-day supply. The box comes with 30 individual packets inside. Each day, you simply rip open the top of one of these little packets and sprinkle the stuff on your dog's food before eating it. It's light brown in color and has a few white speckles in it. My dog is NOT picky (of course) and he gobbles it up on his food like it wasn't even there.The most notable thing is this...this stuff actually WORKS. My dog continues to eat ""garbage"" on a daily basis, but as long as I am giving this to him each day, he can get through it. He has not had diarrhea since the first day that I started giving this to him! Since that was 5 months ago, that is a HUGE success in my book! He has no side effects at all from this. And, I know that it's working because I ran out of it and he had to go for 2 days before the next shipment arrived. During those two days, he was definitely feeling it - upset stomach and loose stool. As soon as he took this again, he was fine!Yes, this may be expensive for use on a daily basis for some people. But, for me, it's worth it. I now have confidence that I can take my dog on vacation and actually enjoy it and not have to go home early because of his intestinal issues.Fantastic product that I have already reordered many times and plan to continue to this every day going forward.

A1GFQ9Q03A9800,I have a kitten who has a condition called Cerebeller Hypoplasia (wobbly cat syndrome). So she needs to be able to balance herself.

Well after I received this product, the package CLEARLY states MADE IN CHINA!  I blame Kong, as Amazon probably prints the description that Kong writes up.  I'm returning it.  If you trust anything made in China as safe for your pet or child, then go ahead and order this.

A2H7SBMRMX61ER,"We recently purchased the Sportdog 425 collar for our Bullmastiff mix and the Dogtra IQ Remote Trainer for our Bichon. Both collars have a long range,  500 yards for the Sportdog and 400 yards for the Dogtra. For 2 months of the winter we live in the Florida panhandle at a very dog friendly beach. That is why we need the extra range. Both dogs have been trained to verbal commands so these were not purchased to train the dogs. When they are on the beach we like to let them run loose as this is the only time they get to run unless we go to a dog park. Both dogs know to come when called but if they see another dog, they are off. The little one is not as well trained as the big one and when she takes off he follows her lead even though he knows better. That being said both of these collars are great for getting their attention. We purchased the Sportdog 425 first for the big dog a week before purchasing the Dogtra IQ for the small dog. We were hoping to get by with a less expensive model for the little dog, but that turned out to be a piece of crap and a separate review. Even though the Bullmastiff is a 90 pound dog the 2 setting on nick gets his attention. I hardly ever have to use the nick button because he responds most of the time to the tone. There are really only 2 things I don't like about the Sportdog. One is to use the vibrate you have to turn the dial to V/T. That changes the nick and continuous buttons to vibrate. To return to the shock you have to turn the dial and that is not real easy. The other thing I don't like is the cheap plastic collar. The collar was very long and several inches had to be removed for the big guy. The holes are very close together so it is hard to make sure you get it in the correct position every time. I think a quick release collar would work much better, then you could adjust it once and be done. And quick release collars are just plain easier to use than buckles. Also it may not last that long with the constant bending to get it buckled. The only thing I can say good about this collar is it would be easy to clean and maybe that's the point if it's primarily for hunting dogs. One of the things I like best about the Sportdog is the company sells replacement parts for about everything, including the rechargeable battery. Not sure about the Dogtra IQ but you can send it back to the manufacturer for repair. The charge on the battery does last a long time. So far we have only been charging it once a week. The charge on the Dogtra is lasting about the same so far. We do take the collars off and turn it off when the dogs are in the house. The Sportdog also comes with two sets of prongs, short and long for smaller and larger dogs, the Dogtra comes with one set. Both collars come with a lanyard for convenience. Both units come with a dual wall charger so the receiver and transmitters can be charged at the same time. Both have a one-year warranty. They both turn on and off. Once they are on they stay on. They don't have to ""wake up"" like some of the less expensive collars.The main reason we purchased the Dogtra IQ for the small dog is that it was recommended for small dogs. Actually, the receiver is about the same size for both collars but the Dogtra weighs .8 ounce more than the Sportdog. I would guess that the main reason it is recommended for small dogs over the Sportdog is the shock settings are much more adjustable on the Dogtra than the Sportdog. Having tested the collars myself, the 20 setting on the Dogtra is less stimulating than the 1 setting on the Sportdog. The Dogtra doesn't have a tone. It has a vibrate, nick and continuous button. So far we have only used the vibrate on the Bichon. The Dogtra has the exact same cheap collar as the Sportdog. Both transmitters are about the same size. The Dogtra does have a comfort adapter that can be purchased for an additional $17. If it seems the collar is irritating the Bichon's neck then I will try that. The collar can be adjusted down to about 3 inches so the collar size is not an issue for anyone.Update: we've had the collars about a month now and they are working great. I originally said the collar part was cheap plastic. I've changed my mind about that. We had another that was cheap plastic that ended up breaking from use. These must have something else in them because they don't look like they will break. I would still prefer a quick release but they all seem to come with buckles. The Dogtra does not seem to irritate the Bichon's neck at all. Neither dog seems to mind wearing their collar. They both respond to the tone or vibrate.

A32WT1ZEE4QGZB,"My vet recommended Feliway, both in room diffusers and spray form for my 19 year old cat, who was, well, just getting too old to keep it together urinary wise.  This is the one cat in the world that refused all her life to use a cat box but was always very good about going outdoors to do her business.  But in the last six months of her life, she had many urinary tract infections and began to not want to go out.  I could not blame her; she was still enjoying her life otherwise and I could not put her down just because she was peeing in the house.  After plugging Feliway in the electric socket she started going outdoors on her own again and actually did so up to the last day when it was her blessed time to go.I have another cat, who has a herpes virus in her eye.  She is a nervous cat and gets stressed at the drop of a mouse hat.  I had put away the Feliway after the other cat passed.  I got it back out for this cat because her herpes virus gets triggered by stress.  She requires 2x daily eye drop treatments to reduce a secondary infection and which, guess what, stresses her.  The virus itself is incurable.  I not only use diffusers throughout the house but also use the Feliway spray on the towel I use when administering the eye drops. Once a week when the housekeeper has been in the house and the cat comes out from her hiding place once again, I put one spray onto her favorite sitting area, wait a few minutes and then pet her.  Within seconds she is purring and flipping over asking for a tummy rub.  Over time she has calmed down considerably, plays more often and has less secondary infections arise.  When she starts to amp up and gets all skittish again, I realize that the diffuser need to be refilled.  The difference is noticeable.

A24X4X8PP0YB76,"We recently adopted a Cavapoo dog from a rescue facility, and quickly realized she had a severe allergy and hair loss problem. She would repeatedly scratch and itch to the point she would only stop when in pain/blood would surface at the site. After going to several vets, and having allergy testing done, we went to a hypoallergenic dog food, bought Ultra Paws Rugged Dog Boot (also listed here on Amazon), and started giving her medicated weekly baths and daily Zyrtec per the Vet's recommendation. The boots prevented her from scratching herself with her nails. (yes we trimmed them down). The overall appearance of the Seameal looks like ground pepper from afar, and has a algae/sea weed smell to it, but our dogs consume it without problem once mixed in with their food and topped off with salmon oil.

She would repeatedly scratch and itch to the point she would only stop when in pain/blood would surface at the site.  After going to several vets, and having allergy testing done, we went to a hypoallergenic dog food, bought Ultra Paws Rugged Dog Boot (also listed here on Amazon), and started giving her medicated weekly baths and daily Zyrtec per the Vet's recommendation.  The boots prevented her from scratching herself with her nails. (yes we trimmed them down).  The overall appearance of the Seameal looks like ground pepper from afar, and has a algae/sea weed smell to it, but our dogs consume it without problem once mixed in with their food and topped off with salmon oil.

AK0CENM3LUM28,"Cat Hormone Feliway Refill / B000RI6C7KOK, we've got this cat who just does *not* stop talking. I don't know why - his sister is quiet as a lamb. And though it has been getting ""worse"" for the last two years (or maybe it just *seems* like it), it's not a new thing - he's almost six, and the vet thinks he's healthy as can be. He's just *really* fussy, whiny, anxious, and petty - he likes to follow the husband around the house hissing at him. Cute, but not conducive to headaches.I really don't know that these Feliway packs work - we've gone through three bottles now. When I first bought them, I was praying for a miracle, like our little ""problem child"" would suddenly be silent, serene, content, and happy. Yeah, no such luck. However...every month and a half or so, he starts *really* ramping up the yowling, and I start saying, constantly, ""Baby, what's WRONG?"" and then I go check the calendar and it's been over a month since I plugged in the last new Feliway bottle. And, sure enough, the darn thing is empty. So I go another week or two and finally in desperation I order another refill, and then our baby seems to calm down...comparatively...until the bottle is emptied and we go through this cycle again.So, basically, I think this is helping, but I don't have a lot of before-and-after scientific data to go on. The cat has noisy days and less-noisy days, and it SEEMS like when the Feliway runs out, we get treated to a whole string of noisy days, and when the Feliway comes fresh in the mail, things quiet down a bit. Since I really do feel like these are helping, I'm buying more, but I wanted to share my story - as far as I can tell, Feliway *does* help, but don't expect a miracle.~ Ana Mardoll",AK0CENM3LUM28,"Cat Hormone Feliway Diffuser with Refill / B000WHUOEIOK, we've got this cat who just does *not* stop talking.

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.",AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better.

I mixed (layered) the two (which it now says not to).I have a 50G column tank with a Renna XP2 canister and had 3, 5 year old angel fish in it and loads of live plants, Co2 and LED light.  I had been using Flourite but decided to change things up a bit and go with the ADA black look.  Tank has been stable for 5 years.I left my filter alone, cleared out the fluorite, and gave a really gentle rinse to this stuff and put it down and then put the Carib Sea on top and then put a couple driftwoods back in and re-planted my tank.  My fish were all in my 10 G quarantine tank for the day.  I filled the tank, de-chlorinated, started up the filter, turned on the lights and Co2 and put in a few drops of the clarifying stuff one of these products came with.  Let the tank run for about 6-7 hours and get up to temp and it looked good.  All seemed ok.  A water test (one without ammonia test on the strip) looked good, Ph was good.  So I put my fish in and they seemed happy.  Ate well and were exploring the &#34;new&#34; tank.  I went to bed and when I got up 7 hours later, all of my fish were dead.  I did another water test and checked the ammonia with the ammonia test this time and it was through the roof.  With all of my fish dead I just let the tank run for a week with nothing in it and it stabilized.  Did a 40% water change and waited another week, still stable.  Put a few cheap mollies in and they thrived so I bought new baby angels and all has been good.  Talked to other hobbyists and many others said these substrates can cause an ammonia spike.  So please take heed and maybe give 24 hours before re-introducing fish.  Be sure it really is stable.I like how easy it is to plant in this.

In the months that we experiments with  the more affordable joint chew, we saw serious degeneration.

A switch back to the Synovi G3 showed significant improvement in just a week. At this rate, I would expect her to rebuild her muscle and be able to handle 4 mile walks within a month.Even though I know Synovi G3 works, I am open to seeing if there is indeed something that may be better.

AJD41FBJD9010,"My dogs like the taste of this food just fine, although they didn't go crazy for it. (I purchased it for a dog who was very thin and needed to gain weight.)The ingredient list of this food sounds great-- no corn or other indigestible grains, and lots of great healthy vegetables, fruits, and carbs in addition to high quality meats and probiotics. There are NO yucky ""meat by-products""-- just meats and meat meals you can feel good about. Unfortunately this food has a higher than normal fat and protein content. Very high protein (minimum 32% in this food) may not be a good choice for every dog (this is especially a concern for older dogs). The fat percentage (minimum 18%) may great for working dogs and active dogs, but the average American couch potato dog could pack on pounds with that much fat unless you increase exercise and/or reduce your portion size (and that may lead to a dog who doesn't feel full/stays hungry).If your dog is already overweight you would probably want a food with one-third the fat of this product. If you decide to use this food I think it would be a good idea to monitor your dog's weight carefully to avoid having weight gain sneak up on you and your best pal. I am skeptical of dog foods which claim to be perfect for all life stages, too-- puppies and 15 year old dogs can survive on the same foods, but that doesn't mean the same foods are ideal for each dog.You might want to compare this with similar high-quality holistic foods such as Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs..

A1IU84K9F2NX2A,"I won't rant and rave about the benefits and drawbacks of using a headcollar - each dog is different and responds differently to various training tools, and I'm assuming that you've found this product based off your own research and recommendations from trainers and friends.The hard part is deciding which headcollar type to use. In the past decade, I've used several different headcollars, including the Halti, the Gentle Leader, the Petmate AKC Headcollar, and the Holt. In my opinion, the Holt is the sturdiest, most comfortable, and most flexible headcollar of the whole bunch, and is a worthy successor to my previous favorite, the Halti.The Company Of Animals Halti Head Halter Black Size Halti Head Halter Black Sz 0 Training & Behavioral AidsThe Halti was, previously, the best halter for a very simple reason: it had side-straps on either side of the dog's face that prevented the noseband from riding up a dog's face and digging into the dog's eyes. It also worked without cinching the dog's mouth shut, like the Gentle Leader. However, the noseband was not padded, and while I made my own homemade padding for the noseband, it was at least very wide to prevent the material from biting into the dog's skin (unlike the Gentle Leader). The Halti generally came only in black, though colors could be found online. The Halti, despite being designed to function loose (and allowing a dog the full use of its mouth), often made your dog look ""vicious"" by wearing a ""muzzle"", particularly in the black color. Prior to the holt, this was the most comfortable.HALTI PROS: comfort, looseness, prevents noseband from riding up, safety buckle connects to collarHALTI CONS: limited colors, no padded noseband, can not be cinched tight for short-nose breedsGentle Leader Head Collar, Size: Small, Color: Royal BlueThe Gentle Leader, however, was the choice for short-nosed breeds. The Halti suffered when a shorter-snouted dog pawed at the noseband to remove it. The Gentle Leader's design cinched the dog's mouth closed with a locking mechanism, allowing it to be used snugly on short-nosed breeds. For standard-shaped noses, the cinching could be kept more loose to allow for more comfort. It did not have the side straps like the Halti, so it could ride up into the dog's eyes. The noseband was narrow and not padded (unless you shell out extra $ for the premium version not found in stores), so it bit into the dog's skin at the top of the nose. However, it came in multiple colors which helped it look less like a muzzle.GENTLE LEADER PROS: color choices, cinches tight for short-nose breeds, safety buckle connects to collarGENTLE LEADER CONS: uncomfortable narrow non-padded noseband (note: premium GL has nose padding, but still narrow), can ride up into eyesPetmate 3/4-Inch by 16-24-Inch Medium AKC Padded Dog Halter, BrownNew to the game was the Petmate AKC-branded headcollar. This came in many colors and was pre-fitted with a fleece padded noseband. The noseband color is always brown, and there are additional options for colors of the straps. This headcollar looked the least like a muzzle. However, the locking mechanism was not sturdy and would often slide, allowing dogs (even long-nosed breeds) to paw the noseband off their face. It also did not come with a safety strap to connect the headcollar to a dog's normal buckle collar (though one could be homemade very easily). It also buckles underneath the neck, rather than on the side of the face.PETMATE AKC PROS: color choices, fleece padded nosebandPETMATE AKC CONS: loose & slide-able lock, no safety strap to connect to collarNow, onto the Holt. The Holt is identical to the Halti except for two key features: a ""camlock"" and a foam-padded noseband. The camlock is a very tight locking mechanism that does NOT budge when the dog paws at the noseband. It is a great tool to keep the headcollar ON your dog. For short-nosed breeds, the camlock can be set tight and will stay in place. It has the same great features of the halti to prevent the noseband from riding up into the eyes, and the safety strap to connect the headcollar to a buckle collar. In addition, the noseband is padded with black foam material, not fleece, and is extremely soft and comfortable. It is sewn on the underside of the headcollar, and does not interrupt the color (can not be seen while the dog is wearing the headcollar). The Holt comes in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and blue.HOLT PROS: extremely comfortable, foam padded noseband, noseband doesn't ride up into eyes, camlock keeps noseband in place even with short-nosed breeds, multiple colorsHOLT CONS: ???If you are considering a headcollar to train your dog, I highly recommend the Holt for all breeds. It is a worthy successor to the Halti and addresses the cons of that headcollar.Please note that I have included customer photos showing the Halti and the Holt side-by-side in the ""customer photo"" section here:Coastal Holt Dog Walking Collar, Blue, Size 0",A1IU84K9F2NX2A,"I won't rant and rave about the benefits and drawbacks of using a headcollar - each dog is different and responds differently to various training tools, and I'm assuming that you've found this product based off your own research and recommendations from trainers and friends.The hard part is deciding which headcollar type to use.

The Gentle Leader's design cinched the dog's mouth closed with a locking mechanism, allowing it to be used snugly on short-nosed breeds. For standard-shaped noses, the cinching could be kept more loose to allow for more comfort. It did not have the side straps like the Halti, so it could ride up into the dog's eyes. The noseband was narrow and not padded (unless you shell out extra $ for the premium version not found in stores), so it bit into the dog's skin at the top of the nose. However, it came in multiple colors which helped it look less like a muzzle.GENTLE LEADER PROS: color choices, cinches tight for short-nose breeds, safety buckle connects to collarGENTLE LEADER CONS: uncomfortable narrow non-padded noseband (note: premium GL has nose padding, but still narrow), can ride up into eyesPetmate 3/4-Inch by 16-24-Inch Medium AKC Padded Dog Halter, BrownNew to the game was the Petmate AKC-branded headcollar. This came in many colors and was pre-fitted with a fleece padded noseband. The noseband color is always brown, and there are additional options for colors of the straps. This headcollar looked the least like a muzzle. However, the locking mechanism was not sturdy and would often slide, allowing dogs (even long-nosed breeds) to paw the noseband off their face. It also did not come with a safety strap to connect the headcollar to a dog's normal buckle collar (though one could be homemade very easily). It also buckles underneath the neck, rather than on the side of the face. The Petmate headcollar can also ride up into the eyes of your dog.PETMATE AKC PROS: color choices, fleece padded nosebandPETMATE AKC CONS: loose & slide-able lock, no safety strap to connect to collar, rides up into eyes.Coastal Holt Dog Walking Collar, Blue, Size 0Now, onto the Holt. The Holt is identical to the Halti except for two key features: a ""camlock"" and a foam-padded noseband. The camlock is a very tight locking mechanism that does NOT budge when the dog paws at the noseband. It is a great tool to keep the headcollar ON your dog. For short-nosed breeds, the camlock can be set tight and will stay in place. It has the same great features of the halti to prevent the noseband from riding up into the eyes, and the safety strap to connect the headcollar to a buckle collar. In addition, the noseband is padded with black foam material, not fleece, and is extremely soft and comfortable. It is sewn on the underside of the headcollar, and does not interrupt the color (can not be seen while the dog is wearing the headcollar). The Holt comes in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and blue.HOLT PROS: extremely comfortable, foam padded noseband, noseband doesn't ride up into eyes, camlock keeps noseband in place even with short-nosed breeds, multiple colorsHOLT CONS: ???If you are considering a headcollar to train your dog, I highly recommend the Holt for all breeds. It is a worthy successor to the Halti and, thus far, I have found no drawbacks.Please note that I have included customer photos showing the Halti and the Holt side-by-side in the ""customer photo"" section here:Coastal Holt Dog Walking Collar, Blue, Size 0"

However, when I looked at the ingredients, I was very surprised to see cranberries, blueberries, and carrots listed, since all of these things are toxic to cats.  I realize that there are probably only small amounts in this food, but I still think that it seems foolish to put toxic ingredients in the food, especially if your cat will be eating it every day like mine will.

We also bought him a West Paw Bumi.I originally bought the Hurley because of the guarantee. If your dog destroys a West Paw brand toy, they will replace it.

Our dog enjoys chewing on it and you don't ever hear that scraping sound on his teeth like you would a &#34;real&#34; bone. Sometimes we do hear a little &#34;squeak squeak squeak&#34; sound when he nibbles on the little ridges on the ends.Another great thing is that this bone FLOATS. We took it with us to the local reservoir when we taught our dog to swim. You can toss it out in the water and it bobs up to the surface. We tied a rope to ours to make it easier to pull back in. During last summer threw it into the kiddy pool in the backyard and our dog was in heaven splashing around to retrieve it. I think it was extra fun for him since it doesn't sink to the bottom but instead rides the crest of the waves and splashes he makes in the pool.While the West Paw Bumi is his favorite toy, he does love the Hurley bone and gets it when he wants a good chew. Sometimes he tosses it around, probably because it bounces a little when it hits the ground and for whatever reason he thinks that's pretty fun. ;-)I highly recommend you giving the Hurley a try if you are looking for a sturdy toy that is rugged and can withstand heavy chewing.

A12URJ8Z6P9Q8S,"We previously we had this model (the Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow) for about 2 years. The motor ran well and it never broke, so I gave it 2 stars. But it is an older outdated model and our pet store stopped carrying the filters. So I decided to upgrade to a newer product, the Drinkwell Platinum fountain.Drinkwell Platinum Pet FountainI would definitely recommend the Drinkwell and NOT this product. The new Drinkwell has been wonderful because I've definitely seen all three of my cats drinking MUCH more water in the last two weeks than with the Petmate fountain. I can promise you I've found the proof in the litter boxes.The Drinkwell's water stream is much stronger and circulates the water better than the Petmate. It gives the water the power to move most of the debris toward the little trap. That keeps the water bowl so much cleaner; where as with the Petmate, the debris would circulate until it either sank to the bottom or stuck to the bowl walls. In addition, the Drinkwell's filter is designed SO much better (6 tightly divided coal sections). The coal in the Petmate's filter fabric was loose which would allow the coal to clump at the bottom, and water would flow up and over, not through the coal (i believe this filter is divided into 2 sections).Also, the Drinkwell also holds a lot more water. Both products are dishwasher safe, so regular washing is easy for either. However, I can say the old Petmate has many tiny corners which made it a pain when it came to scrubbing off the mineral deposit build up (but my guess is the new one will be too).I would recommend paying the extra $20 and going for the Drinkwell Platinum and staying away from this old model.",A12URJ8Z6P9Q8S,"We previously we had this model (the Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow) for about 2 years.

Before taking the leap and buying one of them, I contacted each brand to see if they would provide me with some samples so I can see if my cat would like it (considering how pricey these brands are in comparison to what I was used to, I didn't want to commit to one brand blindly).  Taste of the Wild was the only company of the three that delivered and oh, did they deliver!

A3B83GRTAX6QOM,"I am a 42 year old female who has 3 older cats ranging from ages 10 - 16.  About 5 years ago, when I adopted my dog, my cats were not happy, to say the least.  One of them started to urinate every night on the window curtain, coffee table or other flat surfaces to express her anger at me for allowing the dog into the house.  I purchased the Feliway product and put one of these in every room, hoping that it would calm her down.It didn't help with her urination, or her anxiety at all.  But, it definitely made my other cats calmer overall - less frustration in the house, in general.  I have given this to my neighbor, who adopted a new stray cat.  He seemed to be very upset being indoors permanently, and was spraying around the house.  After plugging in this product, in only two rooms (the two rooms that he was spraying in), he stopped spraying and generally became more content.This product is the refill for the unit that you plug into any electrical outlet.  It contains 6 refills - they are small plastic bottles which insert into the plastic plug in device.  It works just like any of the liquid air diffusers - you plug it in and the liquid is heated and becomes vapor which moves through the air.  After about a month, the liquid has been used up and you simply replace it.In summary, if you have a distressed cat for whatever reason, I suggest that you try this.  It is pretty expensive if you buy this in a store (for example, I purchased the device originally from Petsmart) but it's a great price if you buy it here.

AWPODHOB4GFWL,"I used this when I first brought my two one-half mix, nine-week old Bengals kittens home, they started having problems. .After two days, they were calm and not pooping, meowing or hissing.Then five years later I moved into a new place. One cat took two days to normalize and the other hid, hissed at the other cat AND her mirror reflection and growled all day and night. She had become the CAT FROM HELL! I purchased two refills of 'Feliway' and literally, within an hour, the problem cat approached me and even climbed into my lap! I suspect it will take another day or so until the problem cat gets along with the normal cat, but this product is unbelievable.

One cat took two days to normalize and the other hid, hissed at the other cat AND her mirror reflection and growled all day and night.  She had become the CAT FROM HELL!  I purchased two refills of 'Feliway' and literally, within an hour, the problem cat approached me and even climbed into my lap!  I suspect it will take another day or so until the problem cat gets along with the normal cat, but this product is unbelievable.

A2SN1C0KVT7K4K,"We recently moved into a home with all wood floors, even in the bedrooms.  Our pups have always had carpeted bedrooms to give them better traction to jump on the bed and the wood floors were making both jumping up and down more difficult for them.  To make matters even more challenging, when we moved we purchased a new mattress set that, at the top, is 26 inches off the ground.  There is a gap between the top of the stairs and the top of the bed, but the pups run up the steps onto the bed just like regular stairs, so there was not a need to purchase stairs that were 26 inches tall (and easily would have been $100+).To put that in perspective, we have Miniature Pinscher/Chihuahua mix (Flapjack) and 2 Pomeranian's (Romeo 7 pounds, Cupid 11 pounds). The tallest one stands about 8 inches at the shoulders. In addition to the pups just being small and the bed being tall, Flapjack is around 13 and has a heart murmur and a sliding patella (knee cap). Cupid is a very insecure jumper on the most solid of surfaces (unless your waving a treat then he can jump buildings in a single bound).  Finally, little Romeo is a mamma's boy that is totally oblivious to how delicate he can be.  If mom gets up in the middle of the night he has to follow her and make sure everything is kosher.  He flies off the bed and sometimes slips on the wood floor with a Klunk sound.We decided on the Telebrands Doggy Steps for several reasons:1.  We thought they were 18.5 inches tall (actually was long and only 12 inches tall).  Will pay closer attention when we upgrade to wooden steps next year as budget allows.2.  They had a removable washable cover3.  The price was $26.00 on Amazon +Free 2 day ShippingI haven't really had any downsides to these steps.  For the $$ they are very sturdy and nicely made.  They do have a plastic frame, but it's not flimsy and everything fits together very well.  They have rubber grips on the bottom to keep it in place.  Ecen though we misunderstood the length to be the height, even at 12 inches tall, my kids don't flinch.I looked at higher priced stairs that looked fancy, but trying to hold to a budget we choose these steps because they were among the tallest in this price range (and any steps are worth the money, because they are cheaper than a hurting pup with a broken leg).We did need to lay on top of the bed and guide the dogs with treats to use the steps the first day.  We did this one pup at a time, each one twice up and down the stairs.  That's all it took.  All 3 pups use the stairs to go up and only Romeo still tries to fly off the bed like Super Pup, so we did put an area rug down to give him some landing traction.All in all a purchase I would definitely recommend to anyone whose pets need a boost, but their wallets can't handle a big boost.  However, if your kid has a severe problem with hip dysplasia, arthritis or other joint problem you may need something taller if your pup can't jump the distance from the top step to the surface of your bed/couch, etc...[...]",A2SN1C0KVT7K4K,"We recently moved into a home with all wood floors, even in the bedrooms.

A2E3B0FA7ZRKOY,"When I had heard enough about dogs getting sick or dying after eating Chinese chicken jerky, I went looking for products made in the US and found this and have ordered several 1 lb bags. When fewer and fewer vendors were listed on amazon and the price quadrupled from my last purchase, I called the manufacturer to see if they had stopped making the product. The person said no, they had reformulated it so I waited for that to show up. Now it has so I went back to the manufacturer's web site to see what they changed.I was appalled by what I found. From my bags of the old product here is a list of the ingredients. Chicken, natural smoke flavor. That's all.Here's the reformulated product ingredient list: Chicken, betaine, brown sugar, cultured dextrose, sea salt, natural smoke flavor, garlic powder, mixed tocopherols (preservative), paprika extract color, rosemary extract.I didn't know what betaine was so I looked it up on the net. After reading about it, I still don't know what it is.The crude protein dropped from 77% to 50%.crude fat increased from 2% to 5%.moisture increased from 18% to 28%.I am not going to give this product to my dog and will make my own chicken jerky in the oven.___________________Update:I just went to a new Petco that opened near me.

AXHIE1NIRSZM5,"My two &#34;large&#34; dogs both weigh in at 12-13 pounds, and they love these chews.  They're both avid chewers, but one per dog will last about 2 months.  At first it was very amusing to see my Pom trying to figure out how to carry something so large (a bit bigger and the little powder-puff could squeeze thru it), but he's got the hang of it now and can run while carrying one.BTW they also make good throwing rings.  My babies are too small to catch them, by they'll chase after them with enthusiasm.  They also fight over them, so I have about four of them now in various stages of destruction.  When I see an unguarded one I pick it up to give to Lady (the inevitable loser in these disputes) when Sonny has all the toys in his &#34;den&#34; under the bed.I have a small fixed income, so I wasn't sure about spending so much on these the first time I bought them, but they last well enough to be worth it.",AXHIE1NIRSZM5,"My two &#34;large&#34; dogs both weigh in at 12-13 pounds, and they love these chews.

A12EDGP5ZGZVJD,"The Stimulo Cat Feeding Station and Activity Center is easy to clean & easy to put together.  Our cat eats his food quickly so he can go try to steal food from the dogs (why a cat would want to eat dog food is beyond me, he's just special).  The Stimulo Cat Feeding Station and Activity Center slowed him down for a little bit.  So we got him the level 3 tubes to use with this, again, it slowed him down for a wee bit.  Now we use this in addition to a couple of other cat games to feed him.  This is the easiest cat feeding game for my elderly parents to use when cat sitting.  (the other cat feeding games are too complicated for my parents to figure out).Cats are rather smart, if yours is at all food motivated, like ours is, you won't have to show him how to get the food.

ACJT8MUC0LRF0,"Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for your animals. I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food. Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis. A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing. I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results. I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long-haired cutie pie who LOVES this food. I changed her food to this one some time ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity. I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it. This is brief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:* Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.* Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.* Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.* Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.* Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.* High DigestibilityNo Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco, where I purchased it, or head to the Natural Balance website. Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals. You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat. I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic.

A11FX8HL2ANK6T,"From Cichlids to Fancy Goldfish I've been keeping fish for 30+ years.Just about every major manufacture and boutique specialty company has a water conditioning and treatment product.I can't say I've tried them all, but close too it. Some products have at the least, minimal effectiveness while others can be potentially dangerous.An example would be Stress Coat which has binding sugar strands in the Aloe. This isn't a problem unless one of your fish has a small scratch or wound.The sugar feeds the bacteria which can lead to major infection and dire consequences.I've been using Amquel for years and it's a fine conditioner, excellent at removing chlorine, and Chloramines, but like all these products - they come with limitations.Well, with one exception and that's Prime by Seachem.A few months ago, I decided to give it a try, and haven't looked back since. Prime doesn't just remove the chlorine and Chloramine it does much more:* Detoxifies any and all heavy metals in your tap water(you can call your water company directly for a list of them and PPM)* Neutralizes Ammonia* Neutralizes Nitrite* Neutralizes high Nitrate to non toxic levels* Removes toxic gases* Will not foam or change PH* Helps regenerate natural slime coatSince using Prime, I've seen a dramatic improvement in all of my fish. In 2010 one of tanks was hit with the dreaded and rare Toxic Tank Syndrome - within 48 hours I had lost nine gorgeous fish - except for one survivor, a single Broad Tail Nymph.Since that ordeal, ""Roxy"" became a bottom dweller spending most of her time laying in a corner. Treatments were conservative, but nothing worked.After my first 50% water change using Prime her behavior began to improve. Now she swims among her tank mates, her color is better, gill movement stabilized and her appetite ferocious. In fact I see improvements in all my fish and in every tank.There simply isn't anything like it, Prime is hands down one of the best things you can do for your fish.In addition to the outstanding, patented formula of Prime - it couldn't be more economical to use. A single 500 ml bottle treats up to a whopping 5,000 gallons of water. A tiny bit goes a long, long way.It should also be noted that in times of emergency the dose can be increased five times, Prime is harmless to fish. It's the only product of it's kind, and towers above any other water treatment on the market - period.If your an aquarium hobbyist be it novice or advanced - I would urge you to add a bottle of Prime to your arsenal of fish care products. Your finned friends will thank you for it.",A11FX8HL2ANK6T,"From Cichlids to Fancy Goldfish I've been keeping fish for 30+ years.Just about every major manufacture and boutique specialty company has a water conditioning and treatment product.I can't say I've tried them all, but close too it. Some products have at the least, minimal effectiveness while others can be potentially dangerous.An example would be Stress Coat which has binding sugar strands in the Aloe. This isn't a problem unless one of your fish has a small scratch or wound.The sugar feeds the bacteria which can lead to major infection and dire consequences.I've been using Amquel for years and it's a fine conditioner, excellent at removing chlorine, and Chloramines, but like all these products - they come with limitations.Well, with one exception and that's Prime by Seachem.A few months ago, I decided to give it a try, and haven't looked back since. Prime doesn't just remove the chlorine and Chloramine it does much more:* Detoxifies any and all heavy metals in your tap water(you can call your water company directly for a list of them and PPM)* Neutralizes Ammonia* Neutralizes Nitrite* Neutralizes high Nitrate to non toxic levels* Removes toxic gases* Will not foam or change PH* Helps regenerate natural slime coatSince using Prime, I've seen a dramatic improvement in all of my fish. In 2010 one of tanks was hit with the dreaded and rare Toxic Tank Syndrome -  within 48 hours I had lost nine gorgeous fish - except for one survivor, a single Broad Tail Nymph.Since that ordeal, ""Roxy"" became a bottom dweller spending most of her time laying in a corner.

A1WOMXOEX90ARI,"Tried this, recently, (in all dry flavors) for my German Shepherd Dog. At first, he wouldn't touch it, but after about a week, he decided he absolutely loves it. The biggest problem is within the first month, he had gained 3 pounds, even though he was eating less than the recommended amount and less than he was previously used to eating. Also, he had soft, oily looking stools while eating this. He is an active, very healthy, well-exercised, older dog. He did seem to be more ""chipper"" and health-wise, he seemed to do fine, except for the softer stools and weight gain, but reluctantly, we had to stop feeding this, exclusively, as we were feeding less and less and he was still gaining weight AND seemed hungry all the time, looking for any other food to eat. Since he loves the taste so much, we have decided to give him only a cup or so a day, in his Kong, with his other food or as training treats and have switched him to another food. I'm not sure I agree with the ""good for all life stages"" philosophy either. In the old days, that was what one did, but now that we know much more about nutrition, I believe that different life stages do require different nutrient levels. Much as humans do. Sadly, for our dog, this can not be the only food he eats, but it will remain a part of his daily diet, since he loves it and did well, except for the fat content.

A3EHH6JLPEEM2B,"I went to dog food advisor to search out a five star food that is affordable and easy to obtain at local stores and decided to try this. I prefer giving my 10 lb poodle turkey formulas and this was right up my alley.The size of the kibble impressed me. Every quality, grain free brand I've tried has been made for bigger dogs and the kibble was large for my poodles little mouth. This is tiny enough for her to eat in comfort but she still must chew it. My dog seems to love it and I've noticed she is a little bit leaner, since she was topping out at 10 lbs. She's a low energy, fearful puppy mill rescue and getting her active is a challenge. This product, combined with a wet food that is limited ingredient, seems to be the best combination for helping her keep her girlish figure.The price point works for me and it's by far the best value for my dollar when it comes to excellent pet food. It's sold in 4 local stores in my neighborhood, so if I run out and don't have time to order more on Amazon, I can run to the store and pick up a bag. My previous food was only sold online and was a hassle to get.Finally, let's talk about Number 2s. As a pet parent, I know that the first sign of trouble with a dog's health is the condition of their number 2. Since they cannot talk and tell us they have tummy aches and often hide symptoms, this is our early warning system. After about a week adjustment period, mixing her old and new food together to wean her off the old, her system calmed down and the food is 5 star quality coming out as well as going in. (Hey, let's not pretend it's not important).My one concern is the fact that Wellness has had recalls recently. It doesn't effect this review, but I knew going in that Wellness has had a few recalls, so I make sure to keep the kibble in it's original bag so I know the date and lot number and also receipts, in case of a recall. I subscribed to recall alerts at dog food advisor as well, just to be safe.All in all I am very happy with this product.",A3EHH6JLPEEM2B,"I went to dog food advisor to search out a five star food that is affordable and easy to obtain at local stores and decided to try this.

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, and slowly began to not like it. After reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot fully digest corn as they are carnivores. Corn it is just a cheap filler that can cause dogs to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality pet foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value.The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging if the product does not contain the pictured items; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store.",AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food.

APFEQMTX550NE,"Amazing product and instantly takes care of barking.  It works by spraying a little bit of citronella fluid out in front of the dogs face when it senses a bark.  This spray is so unpleasant to the dog although not painful.  It stops them in their tracks every time.  Kind of like a big fat guy coming up and farting in your face I suppose.  Each time I tried the collar on the different dogs, after a few barks the barking stopped.  As long as the collar is on there will be zero barking.  At first, when the collar is off there may still be a little barking.  Soon, there is no barking at all even with it off.  The cons are that on a couple occasions it has gone off when bumped even without a bark, and my unit leaked and I had to send it back for a free replacement.  The cannisters last for many refills as do the batteries.  If you look at the stats on these the effectiveness rate is around 90% vs shock collars at 40%.  Also no pain so humane.

AJD41FBJD9010,"Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- in addition to the indoor cat formula there's a chicken version and a fish version. This food meets a very high standard. No yucky meat ""by-products"", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, plus a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture ""lifebits"" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.I came across this cat food at the local Tractor Supply. I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Here's a summary of the nutritional information:-Recommended daily feeding chart-- amount varies based on age, activity level, breed, and environement, but in general a 5-9 pound cat will eat 1/4-1/2 cup, while a 10-14 pound cat will eat 1/2-1 cup.-One cup contains 478 calories-Major ingredients:Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground barley, fish meal, oatmeal, whole ground brown rice, whole potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, dried egg, dried cellulose, whole sweet potatoes, whole carrots, cranberries, blueberries, flaxseed (natural soource of Omega 6 fatty acids), barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, ycca schidigera, green tea extract, turmeric, salmon oil (natural source of Omega 3 fatty acids), black malted barley, dried chicory root, fructooligosaccarides, oil of rosemary, the expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacgterium thermophilum, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food is a good match for your feline friend.

I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Here's a summary of the nutritional information:-Recommended daily feeding chart-- amount varies based on age, activity level, breed, and environement, but in general a 5-9 pound cat will eat 1/4-1/2 cup, while a 10-14 pound cat will eat 1/2-1 cup.-One cup contains 478 calories-Major ingredients:Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground barley, fish meal, oatmeal, whole ground brown rice, whole potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, dried egg, dried cellulose, whole sweet potatoes, whole carrots, cranberries, blueberries, flaxseed (natural soource of Omega 6 fatty acids), barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, ycca schidigera, green tea extract, turmeric, salmon oil (natural source of Omega 3 fatty acids), black malted barley, dried chicory root, fructooligosaccarides, oil of rosemary, the expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food is a good match for your feline friend.  My cat and I have been really happy with it."

AAEVGE52KL0DJ,"This refill is identical to the bottle included withFeliway Plug-In Diffuser with bottle, 48 Milliliters. The six pack is much more economical to buy. In case you aren't familiar with the diffuser and this product itself, below is a copy of my review of the actual Feliway product:We have two cats in our house and both are neurotic.--- Rex, our cat, seems to suffer from separation anxiety and drags my wife's clothing around the house every time she leaves. In addition, he seems to hate, not just dislike, but HATE my father, who lives with us. Dad's always been nice to Rex, but Rex will often swat at him when he walks by. Rex also is very defensive of the house and anytime another cat comes by the house, he runs from door to door and window to window stalking it, and then sometimes sprays near the doors.--- Princess, my father's cat, seems to suffer from OCD. Besides being skittish around new people, she will lick herself until she has large bald patches on her legs. The vet has put a couple kids through college with the money she's taken off my father, but Princess never seems to improve.After being recommended by the new vet my father has found, we decided to give Feliway a shot and bought the diffuser and one refill. Dad has it installed in his bedroom, and from the first night it was in use, he said Princess started sleeping on the side of the bed nearest the diffuser. She seems to be less skittish around visitors. She used to disappear the whole time they were in the house. Now she will come out and sit at a distance and watch people. Dad says Rex seems to be a little nicer to him, and spends more time in his room (Rex used to just go in the room to use that litter box and see if any of Princess' food was left out).I wouldn't say that Feliway has made a huge difference in our home, but there have definitely been some changes in behavior in our cats, so it certainly does something. If you are living paycheck to paycheck, the small difference it makes (at least if you have similar results to us) in cat behavior probably wouldn't justify the added expense. If you have the expendable income and are out of options with your neurotic cat, then maybe you should give this stuff a try.",AAEVGE52KL0DJ,"These refills are identical to the bottle included withFeliway Plug-In Diffuser with bottle, 48 Milliliters.

AGHKBWZB4VXCE,This collar is super cute and affordable. I bought one in green and one in blue for both of my cats. With Safecat brand collars I have purchased in the past my cats have figured out how to take them off and they eventually just break or get lost. I have waited about 6 months to review these collars just to give them a chance to see how they hold up. Both cats still wearing them! Still looking just as cute as the day I put them on. And the breakaway function still definitely works. I am happy knowing that my cats are safe and stylish.,AGHKBWZB4VXCE,"This collar is super cute and affordable.

A5QCJAFUVKPI,This is our Puppys very favorite toy. We have a 5 months teething golden retriever. She chews the heck out of it but has yet to rip a hole in it. I actually liked it so much I went and bought 5 other Kong Cozies to go with it but for some reason this is the one she chooses to sleep with.

A3L83OV2D94LHJ,"Dogswell Vitality Jerky Treats for Dogs, Salmon Flavor is stinky fishy smell but my dog loves it! It is all natural and I figure she can get some of her Omega 3s. I use it during our walks, when we practice commands in the backyard, and when I want her to go in her crate. I usually limit 5-6 pieces of either this or the Cadet Duck Breast Jerky per day.The only human food that she gets as a treat s a sliver of apple of cucumber, salmon, a cooked egg, or a piece of cheese.

I would take 1 cup of the dried food and add 6 ounces of the wet food. I tried adding broth. I tried adding 6 ounces of human pink salmon. She would take a bite here and there , She would eat the whole thing but it would take her hours. By then there would flies and ants all over her bowl. So finally after two years I decided to try a non-salmon wet food.I bought Paul Newsman's brand which she kind of liked and then I discovered Trader Joe's Chicken Chunks that she loves. I use the same amount of 6 ounces of the wet food with her dried food. It's 1/2 of the price of other products, it has all natural ingredients, and she licks her bowl clean in 5 minutes flat.

It seems to have a little camera which detects Cat movements and has soothing sounds of ocean breezes or other music you choose.

A3R68RWKCSLJNA,"These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there, and we've tried several. I don't think any are truly ""indestructible"" since there's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim, but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs.  Just be *sure* to buy the size that suits your dog; don't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily!  Dr. Noys' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack, and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch. (Squeakers are not indestructible; that's why they include an extra. But the advantage here is that they are very secure, and can't be eaten.) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys. Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy! ;-)  In the larger sizes you can replace the squeaker with a tennis ball for active dogs.Pay attention to the sizes listed: extra-small is really small, best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies. Medium will work for most dogs, but if your dog is a shredder, loves to destroy plush toys, only get the large sizes. If you have certain breeds, like Staffordshire terriers and bull dogs, then perhaps another toy would be a wiser choice. You know your dog.So if you're tired of buying so-called ""dog toys"" that are really glorified baby toys and are easily destroyed, try these.  Ours have lasted for two years with hard play, only replacing the squeakers. Even better, they're usually included in the Amazon 4-for-3 promotion, so you can get one free if you buy four (smaller sizes)!  That way you can test out different designs, or save one for later.

A17M1HL6U2GS7M,"We have 5 cats, all of whom are pampered and loved. I bought this food when one of my special guys lost a lot of weight and became sickly. His coat was ragged and sad looking, and he looked thin. Of course, we went to the vet, and got an infection treated (thank goodness it was treatable), but the vet thought that he might have a problem with wheat. So we tried this food, and although it is expensive, I count it as cheap because of the change that my guy has had. The food itself looks more like meat than usual canned cat food, but the real proof is in the excitement with which my boy eats! Now, his coat is sleek and healthy looking. Instead of nosing the food and then walking away, he eagerly eats it. He has gained weight. He is frisky again, which I never thought I would see. He had been so listless, and now with a little weight on him, he is playful and happy once more. I think that his antibiotic therapy did a lot for him, but I think that this food helped provide him the nutrition to complete his recovery. And the wheat issue?

AY95YFL66L91B,"After I initially set up the ""Drinkwell Hy'Drate Cat Fountain"" I didn't think it would prove to intrigue my cats (7 total), and they were slow to accept it and drink from the bowl which held the pump/fountain. However I could see the potential (in design) to eventually win my cat(s) approval and acceptance. One of the first things I did was to locate a bowl that wasn't too large or too small. Glass ""Pyrex"" bowls/containers work nicely. I ended up with a square bowl (rounded corners), clear glass, about 3 inches deep (about 6""x 6""x 3""). Fill the bowl w/sufficient water to cover the pump/fountain. (I use filtered tap water, or bottled spring water). Set the intensity (flow rate) or speed to the second mark (not the lowest). Bigger bowl/containers and larger water volume will likely necessitate choosing higher speeds to move water flow and attract the kitty-cats.I was able to soften or reduce the noise level on the water pump. The two little suction cups on the bottem of the internal pump did not adhere to the base. So it is likely that the pump is rattling around inside the device (unit housing) and causing excess noise. To remedy this concern/problem, I inserted to small rubber foam pieces on both sides of the pump. (I used foam that is actually ear guard/inserts designed to protect the ears of hunters and machine operators). They were the perfect size, and minimized pump virbration, though the pump noise is minimal even if one does not make these adaptations.I now have two such fountains set up in my home. The maintenance and convenience is much less that traditional water fountains and of course, not nearly as bulky or large. However, I did note that one reviewer wrote that maintenance was very little and far less than other fountains/pumps. I don't understand how that reviewer could make such a claim, if he or she is disassembling the pump by removing the Impeller, Stator, Flow Control, and Intake Plate (internal components) at routine cleaning intervals.  This is one down side or unfortunate feature, and yet hardly no different from any other pet fountain on the market. That is merely the ""nature of the beast"" in terms of maintenace and cleaning the device.Overall, I believe the product to be exceptional in design and purpose.

The Litter Genie does do a good job at odor reduced litter storage.My only real gripe is that it is fairly expensive for the refills for what is in effect 50 cents worth of plastic bag in a 50 cent holder...Ahh the price of laziness...,A4A5DBXT8M1E4,I had been using litter Robot automatic litter boxes but my current living situation has no room for them so I had to go manual.

ATJAF20Y6853I,"It's important that you give this stuff at least a month to work, sometimes more. A common issue for cat lovers is an anxious or spraying cat, especially when introducing another cat or dog or baby, change happens in the form of a move, an upheaval in the family routine, or a new person in the house. One thing to really understand is it usually won't go away until you take steps to help the situation. You will have to make an effort to be a part of the solution for your animal friend.Something that worked for us was this Feliway in combination with treats called ""Calming"" and an herbal tincture called Tranquility. (FYI: I'm not a vet, check everything with your vet.) When our refills run out, I notice a difference within days. Our ""problem cat"" becomes anxious and begins to bully the others and spray.Just an FYI: The shelters are overfull due to foreclosures so the chances a cat or dog will find a home and not be euthanized is pretty slim.Hard truth, but even more reason to work through this challenge with something that depends of you to solve this issue with your animal companion and not give up.You must be patient. 90% of an animal's behavior issue is about the human family figuring out what they are doing to create this issue, figuring out how to solve it, following through and sticking to something with patience..and 10% of the animal following your lead.Animals above all, always want to please us.It would have received 5 stars if this product had a lower price, it isn't cheap.

A1QXE7OX7MSL2H,"We have four cats, all of whom have very, very different tastes -- one eats anything, one eats only one type of dry food EVER, and the other two are somewhere in between. So I was thrilled that all four of them love these treats. Everyone comes running now when I shake the bag - there seems to be no preference between the chicken and salmon flavors at all.The pockets are half-marble size cylinder of playdoh-like treat, that you can mash over and around small pills. We have three cats who receive pills at least once a day, and this has made the process completely painless for everyone. Our petsitter wrote us a note to thank us, in fact, and has recommended these to all her other clients.One note on the size -- our cats are ""chewers"" or ""swallowers."" The swallowers don't seem to chew these treats at all, just gulp them down no problem. The chewers actually chew these treats, and spit out the pills. We get around this by tearing each treat into two pieces, and tossing the empty piece first. The second piece, with the pill, seems to go down faster, without a spit-out pill.A second note is that these are much too small for capsule-type pills, especially for chewers. If your cat is on larger capsules (like some antibiotics are), you may need to find another solution, like emptying the capsule into a treat, or just using these as a reward after giving the capsule ""the old way.""",A1QXE7OX7MSL2H,"We have four cats, all of whom have very, very different tastes -- one eats anything, one eats only one type of dry food EVER, and the other two are somewhere in between.

A3MUV7YUWV4GBD,"Review for 24&#34; version:I have three Miniature Dachshunds. I know it seems weird that we buy the 24&#34; version of this toy due to the size of the breed, but they like to have the larger toy to play with. My younger two dogs absolutely love these toys (in every variety so far) and they last even after they're torn. The first thing that my dogs destroy are the squeakers, although they don't tear up the toy, they eliminate the squeak. After a while, they are able to gnaw holes in the fabric of the toys. Do not let this deter you from purchasing these toys as my two dogs will keep gnawing until they rip a toy to shreds... toys in the past would last maybe a week if we lucked out; these toys last an average of a month or more before we need to throw them out. Even when it's time to throw them out, the dogs still want to play with them!I would recommend the 14&#34; to anyone with a small toy dog, but even a Miniature Dachshund likes the 24&#34; better...",A3MUV7YUWV4GBD,"I have three Miniature Dachshunds.

ADKAZSI0W1HVZ,"I purchased This With the Original Senses Circuit to connect them together and make a large play center for my cats. They have a lot of interest in the ball that lights up when pushed around (the auto-off feature after a few seconds is great, so it doesn't burn the light out quickly); however, it's gotten very little use in the weeks I've had it because the blue tops of the tunnel easily pop off when they reach in to tap the balls.When this happens, they simply ""catch"" their target (the ball) and go on about their day-game over. Every day I reset the tunnel-tops in their slots and have to find the ball under whatever furniture it's rolled under to put it back and within a few hours, the toy is taken apart again.It's not just one section of the tunnel-it's any piece. The tops simply won't stay attached. I'm guessing I'll have to come up with some sort of ugly tape-down method to keep it secured to actually get some play time out of this (since it does seem to have their interest).",ADKAZSI0W1HVZ,"I purchased This With the Speed Circuit to connect them together and make a large play center for my cats.

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are water sufficient for processing, meat by-products, chicken, turkey, and wheat gluten. At least there is chicken and turkey in it, which is the only reason it got more than 1 star from me. But other than that its all nasty stuff. Wheat Gluten is just gross and by-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Other Friskies flavors are even worse than this one. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness.

A2HIILPM3JRKID,"I'm not going to say this is the best food on the market, but I do like it alot. My dog loves it. Ive had no problems such as gas, vomitting, or poop issues. Ive used pricier brands that seemed TOO natural in what they contained, and they did cause loose stools or gas, no matter how they were introduced. Cheaper I'd never go, but I feel that that NUTRISH beef/brown rice is a great option if you are on a budget. I consider it to be on the higher end of the affordable food options. I am judging that by the ingredients, kibble size, and experience with it, as well as how my dogs have done with it.I'd pay more for this food, but am grateful that its priced like cheap brands of dog foods that contain crap, like corn as one of the 1st two ingredients. This product is not advertising what it is not. I did notice that when I tried the chicken for variation, my pup would pass gas and eat more than usual, two major negatives- so back to beef+rice it is. We own a 6lb chihuahua who loves his food and has been on this since he was 12 weeks. We got a baby chow chow who is now 5 months and doing wonderfully on it as well. I add fish oil or olive oil to their food once a week as well. I'd like if it were available in more places locally, but online at a discounted rate with free shipping works. Would recommend.

I did notice that when I tried the chicken for variation, my pup would pass gas and eat more than usual, two major negatives- so back to beef and rice it is. We own a 6lb chihuahua who loves his food and has been on this since he was 12 weeks and is now 3. We also got a baby chow chow who is now over 6 months and doing wonderfully on it as well. I add a teaspoon of fish oil or olive oil to their food once a week as well. I'd like if it were available in more places locally, but online at a discounted rate with free shipping works. Would recommend. It's also MADE IN THE USA, as per it's labeling, which had been a point of concern for some buyers in earlier days. Now they specified it on the bag. FYI: That I know of, Nutrish is sold locally at Stop&Shop;, Walmart, and Duane Reade if youre in NY and I've only seen it in 6lb size, never this large."
A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,"We had a cat that was a very good cat until the kids came along. She hated the kids. Everywhere the kids were, she'd follow and urinate. If the baby was in the crib, she'd urinate in the crib. If the baby was on the comforter, she'd urinate on the comforter. It got to the point that we were prisoners in our own home. Everything the baby lay on could never be left out. We had to make sure all blankets and cribs and anything the baby touched were locked in a room away from the cat.When my daughter came along, the cat went to war. She decided she'd had enough of kids and was going to abandon her litter box.I had spent so much money trying to get the cat to use her litter box. Feliway was a failed experiment. We had it plugged in the dining room, where she decided to urinate all along one wall every single day. It did nothing to deter her.

AD0OENWU7N4L6,"Bought this for my wee house guest. She came to us riddled with fleas and very uncomfortable. I was looking for a product that wouldn't be too strong for a very small animal. She's a deer chihuahua and barely five pounds. I was worried that one of the popular flea medications would be too strong for such a small creature since the repellant has strong chemicals in it.I opened the capsule & added it to her food. She didn't notice it and just gulped it down with her food. I did combine this with the Chicken Flavored Flea Control Capsule for small dogs as well. Within the next few hours, I noticed that she wasn't scratching like she had been. The next day, she was completely comfortable and not biting her hind area or using her back legs to scratch. She obtained relief very quickly and showed no adverse side effects.It's been two months and we're going strong!",AD0OENWU7N4L6,"Bought this for my wee house guest.

A1LBIZLET9CW1I,"I got this toy because I had such good luck with another from the same company, theDoggy Hoots Crackler Woodland Raccoon, which has survived roughly 100x longer than any other stuffed toy my dog (a relatively unferocious 50-lb dalmatian/terrier mix) has put his teeth into. This one seems in the same, sturdy mold, if not actually sturdier stitching around the ""hinges."" I'm convinced that this company knows what they're doing.There's just two minor faults that I'll point to:* The squeaker didn't last but a day. My dog managed to pierce it so that it no longer squeaks. This is not a knock on the toy since this happens with every squeaker toy we've had, and the broken squeaker does not make the toy any less appealing to my dog.* The toy arrives looking bright and colorful but after a couple of days of dog slobber its color and brightness has faded significantly.",A1LBIZLET9CW1I,"I got this toy because I had such good luck with another from the same company, theDoggy Hoots Crackler Woodland Raccoon, which has survived roughly 100x longer than any other stuffed toy my dog has put his teeth into.

A1P6W8BHV33LJW,I have two black lab mixes. We had been giving them rawhides for their chewing pleasures. Well our newest lab chews ALOT. We were giving him way too much rawhide to keep him from chewing furniture etc. So I was in Petsmart and saw a Heavy chewers section. I bought one there to try it out and boy am I glad I did. So for Christmas time I ordered a selection from Amazon and they have been a HUGE hit. He loves chewing on them and they are holding up well. The only issue with this one is that only the small end is getting chewed on at this point. I also don't have to worry about the amount of rawhide he's getting!

AI32AO3TTCTY7,"I bought this bowl for my Mini-Schnauzer who was able to eat a cup of food in less than 20 seconds and later got an upset stomach. The bowl is made of the flimsiest, cheapest injection molded plastic and consequently, has no weight. It probably costs about $.50 to make in China and so the price is an affront. It has about the same weight as the throw away plastic plates you buy for picnics so for $16.00 a bowl it's a lot less impressive in person that it is in the picture.I wouldn't mind if it worked well but when my dog tries to eat out of it he pushes it all over the floor because it's so light. Really now, there are heavy stainless steel bowls that cost a lot less. Then I tried another bowl, the Skid Stop Slow Feed Bowl that costs one third the price and not only is it a lot sturdier and heavier, it also works better. It actually takes my pup a bit longer to get his food out of this bowl and he is more willing to do it. With the Break-Fast Bowl, he got so frustrated chasing it across the floor he refused to eat but with the Skid Stop Slow Feed Bowl, he is willing to work at it as long as the bowl doesn't keep moving away from him!The Skid Stop Slow Feed Bowl really is a much better product and I paid $3.00 more for it at my local pet shop.

A1W4F91DH3XPB2,"I have a six month old puppy, part Aussie Shepherd, who absolutely loved both the Waggin Train snacks I received. First, they are a great size, keep her busy for quite a while when I give it to her. Meat is the first ingredient, so I know the natural and health claims are true. All natural/real ingredients. no preservatives. My only concern was the recommended daily allotment based on dog size. According to the bag, I should only be giving her 1/2 a treat a day, but I know if it were up to her she would eat them all in one shot, lol.",A1W4F91DH3XPB2,"I have a six month old puppy, part Aussie Shepherd, who absolutely loved both the Waggin Train snacks I received.

A13PD0PF0KAAUO,"I was happily surprised because for the firs time my 4.2 lb chihuameranian got her jaws and claws on a 4 lb sized dog toy instead of larger sized stuffed animals. She went to town on this beaver dog squeak toy and a squeak duckie. Now if you are a buyer that expects plush materials in a squeak to for 3 or 4 buck you better rethink and open your wallet more. I just wondered how long this would last because I knew it would be hours or days of enjoyment before the kill. She had a blast squeaking this thing and shaking it like nuts for about a day before she fixated on getting the squeak out. She couldn't open the velcro so so she made her own hole to get the squaker out, as it is thin material, to destroy the squeak gnawing off the whistle. She went though both squeakers in 2 days but still loves to haul the carcass around for me to throw for her. She must still love it because she's got a boatload of other toys and she still gets this to throw and catch. Yes, both the beaver and duck are empty carcasses but she still carries em around.  I got what I paid for and expected and am happy.",A13PD0PF0KAAUO,"For the firs time my 4.2 lb chihuameranian got her jaws and claws on a 4 lb sized dog toy instead of larger sized stuffed animals.

A1QX9ZK3BOU288,"I absolutely love this toy, but not as a chew toy. As a chew toy, this kong ring does NOT live up to the durability of the kong name. The squeaking function and toy itself can be destroyed in a matter of hours (or even less) if your dog really goes at it.The reason I still love this toy, however, is that it is one of the most fun and unique toys to play fetch with! If you hold it perpendicular to how you would hold a frisbee and throw/roll it on the ground it bounces and rolls extremely far. Using this technique and really hurling it at the ground, I can make this toy go much further than a tennis ball. My lab absolutely loves to chase it because the toy bounces up with every little bump in the ground and it takes a little more strategy to fetch than a tennis ball.I have bought 2 of these (medium and large) because my lab loves to fetch it so much. Every time I take it to the dog park and start throwing it, people ask me what kind of toy it is and comment on how fun it looks. My dog carries it around and acts like he's the coolest kid on the playground.The first one lasted several months (I wouldn't let him lay down and just chew on it, it was for fetch only), and my second one lasted 2 months. The weak point in the toy are the two seams where the two halves of the donut fits together. This seam is held together with an adhesive that is prone to weakening in heat (don't leave it in the hot sun or in a hot car all day long). In fact the toy itself warps considerably when left in a hot car all day long. One of mine broke apart at the seam after a couple of weeks and I super glued it back together (this made it last another month and a half).I debated giving this less than 5 stars because it has some very obvious flaws, but I just couldn't because my lab loved it so much and for 10 bucks it was well worth it for me. I will be buying another one.The squeaking is loud until it stops working, which happened quickly on both of mine even though I only used it for fetch.",A1QX9ZK3BOU288,"I absolutely love this toy, but not as a chew toy.

A3DH53FPYSP9E,"My dog is a 65lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially from food. He can also be a bit of a picky eater so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, but I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on Nutrience Natural Healthy Adult Dog Food, 18-Pounds, Seven Fish Medley;Pros+ A nice healthy variety of fish, vegetables, fruit and supplements.+ All ingredients are made in North America (U.S.A. and Canada) which gives me a bit more piece of mind than foods containing ingredients from China.+ Easy to open re-sealable bag with a Velcro strip at the top to help keep food fresh longer.+ Dog loved it and gobbled it up quickly with no fuss.+ No corn, wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.+ A plethora of healthy and helpful ingredients such as Omega 3 & 6, antioxidants, vitamin C & E, glucosamine and chondroitin.+ My dog had no digestive issues after eating this.Cons- Kibble may be a bit too large for smaller or older dogs.- Velcro reseal on the bag isn't air-tight but it's obviously better than no seal at all.- Limited availability in brick and mortar stores.  As far as I can tell it's sold in Canada and online only at the moment.- Expensive for an 18-pound bag.  If you have larger or multiple dogs the price will get a bit hefty.- Strong fish smell, good for the enticing the dog but not so pleasant wherever you're storing the food.- Not Grain Free.My dog really enjoyed Nutrience Natural Healthy Adult Dog Food, 18-Pounds, Seven Fish Medley.  He was of course extremely excited when I approached with the bag (as he is with every new food) and quickly at the half cup I mixed into his bowl.  His current food isDiamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dogs, Large Breed 60+ Chicken Formula, 40 Pound Bagwhich he enjoys, but after introducing him to Nutrience he seems to prefer it over the Diamond brand.  Currently I'm still mixing the two foods until both are gone at which point I'll most likely switch completely toNutrience Grain Free Dog Food, 18-Pound, Ocean Fish.  Although the price is a bit high to purchase on a regular basis, I feel the savings will outweigh the cost of unnecessary veterinary visits due to allergies and infections caused by questionable ingredients in other foods.

AHQ13I9CI4US6,"We tried using both Arm & Hammer Multi-Cat Clump & Seal Clumping Litter, 14-Pound, and Arm & Hammer Clump & Seal  Clumping Litter, 14-Pound Fresh Home, and did not notice a difference between the two. We have three cats who all seemed to have no problem adjusting to a change in litter, so it was certainly satisfactory for the cats. We found that both litters are finer than litters we have used previously, and they worked well in absorbing liquid. Our favorite advantage of both these products is that they do a fabulous job with the stinky part of cat owning. No matter what we've used in the past, as soon as a cat used the litter box, it was time to clear the room or clean the box--really noxious. With these Arm & Hammer Clump and Seal products, there is no stench. I was very surprised since we've tried so many brands, and none of them lived up to their self-proclaimed hype.

I finished the cut very carefully on the lower setting and it was fine. I did first try to use this for my tabby/persian mix cat who kept squirming away so now I know why - sharp and hot! This didn't work at all for trimming the cat's fur - the fur might be too fine so it kept clogging up the clipper blade.

(It was next to my bed room and I could smell... and wow I hated it.) Also I was afraid to have people upstairs to use the guest bathroom (it was called the cat bathroom by friends).As for install: It was so easy! First off I hard plumbed the Genie to my sink with an additional 4 dollar part at the hardware store, and it took me a total of 30 min from start to finish doing all the assembly from un-boxing to plumbing, I did this due to the layout of the bathroom and wanted to keep the toilet for people.  All the houses are hidden in the sink cabinet and it looks like a mini kitty toilet (renamed form genie to kitty toilet by friends) in my guest bathroom now.

They skipped the regular box and went to the genie.. Even the male cat, he had to make sure it was safe for his sister. A bonus is the cats think it entertainment they sit and watch it spin and clean. There is pee or  no poop mess to clean.

BEST SCRATCH POST EVER!!!""I originally posted a very positive feedback about this product (PetFusion Cat Scratcher Lounge).  My cats enjoyed using it, one claimed it for her perch, and it looked very stylish and modern...  ...THEN, after 6 months of having it, it looked just like those $5 corriated bricks you get at the pet store... accept those bricks are not really seen, and if they are... they look that people expect.  A piece of 'furniture' in a room that look partially destroyed looks significantly out of place.My preference is the SmartCat Ultimate Scratching Post by SmartCat.  They've had it for two years, it still looks new, and they use it.  It also engages their core and shoulder/rear leg muscles better, because they are pulling themselves up onto it - not sitting down pawing at cardboard.""",A23OKR7V0B1Z7Q,"I originally posted a very positive feedback about this product.

A2EKJIDMX39591,"This was the first time I had ever used the product and I was very pleased with it. I had used another flea product for years and for some reason it just stopped working. I have two cats that stay indoors but I have two indoor dogs that I take outside to use the bathroom and let them walk around in the backyard, so they aren't outside very long but I do keep flea medication on them. I also keep flea medication on the cats just in case the dogs should carry a flea inside. When my old flea medication quit working I found that my all four of my animals became infested with fleas, including my home. I was absolutely devastated. My basement even became infested and they don't even go downstairs. I had bites all over my ankles and the bottoms of my legs and I thought I would go crazy from the itching. I finally got online and after reading all reviews on different flea medications chose this for my cats and the Bayer Advantage II Green for my dogs. I vacuumed like crazy constantly and bought the Raid spray in the purple can and sprayed everywhere, which will not hurt your pets and finally got rid of the fleas within a little over a month. I did find a few fleas on my dogs after about three weeks, although they were barely moving, but I believe they were jumping off the cats because my dogs have very short hair and you can see their skin, so I went ahead and applied the medication one week early on all my pets and haven't seen a flea since. I also believe that because my pets and home were so infested that it took a little bit longer to get rid of the fleas than it would have if they had been being treated all along with the medication. I'm still not clear as to why my other flea medication quit working. Maybe my pets had just become immune to it. I highly recommend this flea medication to anyone looking for a flea killer and it also did not leave my pets' fur greasy like my other medication did.

A226GFM0Q9L37H,"Our 5 testers have been testing this bag of dog food since we received it. Our dogs range from small to large (shih tzu - lab) and ages 1 1/2 - 8. One of our dog has a sensitive belly, one can be gassy and one other some food allergies- the remaining 2 just eat anything and nothing bothers them.First - all our dogs loved it, no picky eaters here and gobbled it up. The food itself is a mix of hard kibble and then some tender shredded pieces. Again no pieces rejected or prioritized.Purina Pro Plan offers nutrition with antioxidants and the lamb is the #1 ingredient. It supports a healthy heart, strong immune and digestive system, helps for strong teeth and bones, skin and good coat and also with maintaining healthy weight.From an owners point of view, I dislike having corn, wheat, soy and other &#34;fillers&#34; in the food. You are what you eat as they say and its no different for dogs. We found our &#34;allergen&#34; dog had more itchy paws and was at them more with only a little sample of it for a week mixed into her other food. She also got an ear infection towards the end of that week, probably allergy related. So I would Not Recommend for dogs with allergies.Our sensitive tummy pup didn't have any issues. It went down fine, stayed down and he wanted more. So for sensitive stomachs, we were ok on this one. Lamb and Rice formula always did seem to work well for those bellys.Our older dog gets gassy on certain brands and she sure did develop some gas testing out this food. She had no stomach issues, poop issues or such, but was noticeably more gassy.Our other 2 pups had no issues, it was as if we never changed their dog food and that always seems to be the case when we try out new foods. They have no issues with their bellies, gas, weight gain or lose, etc.Besides having the corn..wheat...soy I don't think its a bad dog food. I think its just particular to some dogs and you really won't know til you try a small bag and mix it with your current dog food before changing over (easier on any belly when making a switch) We had mixed reviews here, though everyone loved it, its not best for a few of our dogs yet some its just fine for as long as the owner approves also. I try to stick with no corn or wheat so we see less allergies, gas, upset stomachs and the other dogs again it doesn't matter but we just stick to one brand that works best for everyone, and for us, it has to be a corn/wheat free brand.",A226GFM0Q9L37H,"First - all our dogs loved it, no picky eaters here and gobbled it up.

A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,"Most aquarium filters now use a motor to force water through some kind of filter pad which must be replaced at intervals. However, before there were reliably sealed electric motors, most home aquariums moved water using the ""airlift"" principle, in which a rising column of bubbles pulled water through the filtering material. This is an elegant and just about failsafe method. Debris in the tank cannot ever jam the external air pump which feeds the filter, and if electricity is interrupted, the filter cannot lose siphon, it simply starts bubbling again when power is restored to the air pump. Many fish love to play in the rising stream of bubbles.Hydro Sponge filters, first marketed in the 1990's, are a more recent application of the airlift. Hydro Sponge V is intended for tanks up to 120 gallons. Made of dense, strong plastic with a weighted base which holds the sponge up away from the aquarium bottom, they dismantle easily for cleaning of the sponge. The pores within the sponge provides an enormous surface area for colonization by beneficial bacteria providing very thorough biological filtration.  They can be powered by an air pump with or without an airstone (using an airstone will give finer bubbles and make less noise), or with an electric powerhead for those with larger tanks or who simply feel the need for more energetic water circulation.It is difficult to imagine such a simple device working well. Surprisingly, they are excellent, and can be used as the only filter in the tank for many applications. I've used them on tanks sized from 10 gallons up to 75 gallons, always with good results. The local fish store where I shop has an expensive trickle filter for their dozens of tanks, and every single freshwater tank also has a Hyrdo Sponge or similar sponge filter as well. Apparantly the sponge is doing something which the trickle filter doesn't?Maintainence is as simple as the filter. When you perform your periodic aquarium water change, (20% every week) save some of the old water in a bucket. Separate the top and bottom parts of the filter and remove the sponge from the tank. Squeeze it out in the bucket. See all the stuff which the sponge removed from the water? Reinstall the sponge and refill your tank. Go have dinner with the money you saved not purchasing replacement filter cartridges.In sum, a clever and elegantly simple device which works very well.",A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,"Most aquarium filters now use a motor to force water through some kind of filter pad which must be replaced at intervals.

I can get several Meals out of each Can of Food, my Cats are a little Finicky so I have to try different Flavors and Brands all the time. I have tried other more expensive Foods from Specialty Pet Shops or other Food Boutiques for Pets, however, they don't want any of that, they Crave and like to eat 9 Lives. I am glad there are such Diversity of Flavors to make my Cats Happy and to choose from. I even Feed 9 Lives to several Cats outside and they Love It! ...Thank You D.D."

You know, when it comes to sharing your life with these marvelous creatures I think the world is divided between those humans who ""get it"" and those who never will.I'm a fanatic about our dogs well being, I began  researching dog food more thirty years ago,  eventually making my own. Every ingredient has to pass a litmus test with us, of  course if we ate half as well as our pooches we would be in better health ourselves!As for these cookies - they're superb. Made in the US of simple high quality ingredients and available in a great and varied selection of flavors. These look and smell sensational like cookies right from the bakery and our Bulldogs are CRAZY for them!They're a nice break from the rock hard cookies and a scrumptious treat for any pooch.

One of our dog's many quirks is a recurring case of dermatitis that comes and goes randomly on his belly.

I was interested in trying the Nutrience brand for them.I have to say this flavor, the original, is hands down the favorite amongst all the cats. At first you really need to mix their old food with the new food and gradually switch over. I love that this food is made in the USA. It appears to be top quality and you can actually smell and see it. One thing I appreciate about each bag is they have are resealable. Instead of having a zip lock type seal, they have a Velcro type seal. It comes in very handy and is easy to use and keeps the food fresh.The Original brand contains no wheat, soy, by-products, artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.

AK0CENM3LUM28,"Feliway Refill Pack-6 / B000CPAV3OOK, we've got this cat who just does *not* stop talking. I don't know why - his sister is quiet as a lamb. And though it has been getting ""worse"" for the last two years (or maybe it just *seems* like it), it's not a new thing - he's almost six, and the vet thinks he's healthy as can be. He's just *really* fussy, whiny, anxious, and petty - he likes to follow the husband around the house hissing at him. Cute, but not conducive to headaches.I really don't know that these Feliway packs work - we've gone through three bottles now. When I first bought them, I was praying for a miracle, like our little ""problem child"" would suddenly be silent, serene, content, and happy. Yeah, no such luck. However...every month and a half or so, he starts *really* ramping up the yowling, and I start saying, constantly, ""Baby, what's WRONG?"" and then I go check the calendar and it's been over a month since I plugged in the last new Feliway bottle. And, sure enough, the darn thing is empty. So I go another week or two and finally in desperation I order another refill, and then our baby seems to calm down...comparatively...until the bottle is emptied and we go through this cycle again.So, basically, I think this is helping, but I don't have a lot of before-and-after scientific data to go on. The cat has noisy days and less-noisy days, and it SEEMS like when the Feliway runs out, we get treated to a whole string of noisy days, and when the Feliway comes fresh in the mail, things quiet down a bit.

I used them the full week as it said (2 weeks for severe cases) and now, I just add them every now and then when he seems to be getting an ear infection.  These drops clean the dogs ears as well!  I use them for all the dogs I have  -not just the Boston Terrier now.  I am ordering again.  These ear drops are WELL worth the money!"
A3E3YJJ0KLYECK,"I first purchased the 12 oz bottle to try this shampoo.  Now, that I'm convinced that it works, I purchased the Gallon to save money. I have 2 white Havanese, one of them is 4 years old and the other one is 10 months old.  The coat on the 4 year old Havanese looked dirty/yellowish when he was next to the 10 month old.  What it does not do is remove stains such as tear stains.  With this shampoo his hair comes out soft, no need for conditioner so I save money and spend less time bathing him.  It has a pleasant smell which last about a week but even close to 2 weeks he still smelled clean. I was skeptic about it actually whitening the coat but it really worked!  After a 3 baths, the older Havanese's coat looks almost as white as the puppy's coat.  Actually, I was able to tell a difference when I compared them after the very first bath. As far as I can tell from the ingredients, this product does not contain anything that would harm your pet or the environment (its biodegradable).",A3E3YJJ0KLYECK,"I have 2 white Havanese, one of them is 4 years old and the other one is 10 months old.

A3B83GRTAX6QOM,"I have a 10 year old Beagle who is a &#34;walking garbage can&#34;. I like to say that he will eat anything that &#34;is or ever was food&#34; if you know what I mean. No matter what I do, he will eat anything. As a result, he gets terrible diarrhea and occassional vomiting. Since it doesn't go away on its own, I end up having to take him to the Emergency vet frequently, to be given fluids and anti-diarrheic meds (like Metronidazole which he has taken many times). This has happened multiple times while away on vacation, requiring for me to end my vacation early which was not ideal for both my dog and myself.While at the vet one visit, my Vet suggested that we try this product - Forti Flora for dogs. I purchased one box from my vet to try it out. One box is a 30-day supply. The box comes with 30 individual packets inside. Each day, you simply rip open the top of one of these little packets and sprinkle the stuff on your dog's food before eating it. It's light brown in color and has a few white speckles in it. My dog is NOT picky (of course) and he gobbles it up on his food like it wasn't even there.The most notable thing is this...this stuff actually WORKS. My dog continues to eat &#34;garbage&#34; on a daily basis, but as long as I am giving this to him each day, he can get through it. He has not had diarrhea since the first day that I started giving this to him! Since that was 5 months ago, that is a HUGE success in my book! He has no side effects at all from this. And, I know that it's working because I ran out of it and he had to go for 2 days before the next shipment arrived. During those two days, he was definitely feeling it - upset stomach and loose stool. As soon as he took this again, he was fine!Yes, this may be expensive for use on a daily basis for some people. But, for me, it's worth it.

I hate flower scents so it's not all floral though.She also stays nice smelling for longer after a bath than she has with previous shampoos I have tried."

A1PI8VBCXXSGC7,"A short summary of our problem cat's life....We have the sweetest, friendliest cat ever. He's part of a multi-cat household. His problems, and ours, began when he was 4 yrs. old. He began showing dominance by chasing our 14 yr old cat until she'd hide from him & he also started marking his territory in our home!! If you're wondering, yes, he was neutered. He's lucky, very lucky, that we are so kind-hearted. Instead of doing away with him, he's been banished to our closed-in porch.Through the years, I tried a couple different enzyme products, but got frustrated with them because I'd have to mix just the right amount of enzyme with just the right amount of warm water, pour on the urine spot, cover with a damp cloth and make sure the urine spot remained wet for a required amount of time. I grew tired of that, and started using white vinegar, but it didn't get all the smell out. Now, 13 years later, I read an article about Anti-Icky-Poo, and decided to go for it. The deciding factor was that it doesn't need to be kept wet. Off and on, in about 6 weeks time, I managed to use a quart of it on some urine spots on our closed in porch. Imagine my surprise when that nasty smell was finally gone from the porch!!! This stuff works! I recently ordered the gallon size & haven't had to use much because I'm also usingFarnam Comfort Zone Feliway Electric Diffuser with 48-Milliliters Imitation Cat Pheromone.  My vet sold me some Feliway (75mL) Spray several years ago. I used it a few times but stopped because I wasn't comfortable spraying my furniture and walls with it, & you need to spray often. So, that's when Raskal was banished to our closed-in porch.Using Anti-Icky-Poo and Comfort Zone Feliway Diffuser has almost eliminated our problem...our home is intact and finally our porch doesn't stink. Poor, sweet Raskal is still banished to our porch, which we've made very comfy for him through the years. He even has his own cat house with an incandescent bulb we use to heat it in cold weather. We just can't bring ourselves to trust him in our home any more. Maybe someday I'll be brave, plug in a Feliway diffuser, and give him another chance; after all, I can use Anti-Icky-Poo to clean up his mess. *but I really don't want to be cleaning up that kind of mess in our home**After purchasing Anti-Icky-Poo, I found out that if you have a stubborn or old urine spot, that Anti-Icky-Poo will also work if it's kept wet. So just cover it with plastic, wax paper or tinfoil for a while. You'll use less A-I-P & have quicker results. A.I.P. can also be diluted with up to 3 parts water.Taken from the label: "" Engineered to eradicate urine, it will digest any malodorous decay including liquid or dried fluids from vomit, feces, rotten vegetables, fish, milk, ... skunk musk & more, even smoke.""  ""Don't use directly on pets.""A.I.P. has a pleasant smell that I can't quite describe for you.

We also put some of the paste in it and that works great to keep our dog busy as well.  However, we had a neighbor dog over and he ripped it to pieces in less time than I could get across the room.

This will be a review in three parts, as I feel the fountains are best reviewed in comparison to each other.---Hagen Catit Design Fresh and Clear Cat Drinking Fountain/ B004L4XR3I (2 Stars)The Hagen Catit fountain was such a disappointment to me, because I love the clean modern look of the Hagen Catit products and I love the ""expandability"" of the products they have for sale -- it seems like all their products have some optional add-ons that stroke my ""buy gifts for kitty!"" impulses. Unfortunately, the Hagen fountain I received was super loud and the plug-in was worrisomely hot to the touch. It was quiet from the time we plugged in the unit until the next evening, at which point it had escalated to a dull roar that could be heard from the other side of the house. Cleaning the filter and unit didn't affect the noise, and when we unplugged the unit to clean it, we realized that the power source was burning hot to the touch. I think we received a faulty unit. Probably the company (or Amazon) would have sent out a replacement unit, but I didn't want to try again because the cats didn't seem to care for the ""bubble-up"" nature of this particular water fountain.---Drinkwell Rectangle Multi-Level Plastic Fountain Drinking Dish/ B0056ASTES (3 Stars) [This is the product page you're currently on.]This was my second Drinkwell fountain, received free through Vine after my first one broke. This is a different model and I don't think I like it very much. For myself, I found it difficult to put together -- the unit has to be compressed with your hands and snapped in and out of place, and I found this very difficult to accomplished. (Note: I am a person with a disability. Your mileage may vary.) And this unit, while not as loud as the Hagen, was still plenty noisy -- about an hour after plugging in the fountain in the kitchen, I realized I could hear it humming from the bedroom. I'm very sensitive to electronic noise, and so I didn't care for how loud the unit was in our home. I will say that our cats liked this one just fine, and were not put off by the form factor or the sound (although they were already used to our last Drinkwell, which was far from silent), so I will keep this one for use on our outdoor patio.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.---Pioneer Pet Stainless Steel Fountain Raindrop Design/ B0037NKDSG (4 Stars)This is the fountain we ended up keeping for use in the kitchen. I really like the teardrop shape, and the cats took to the fountain with no issues. I like that they can drink from the fountain or from the relatively-still ""pool"" that collects to the side. Best of all, while the unit isn't noiseless, it's definitely the quietest drinking fountain we've owned -- there's very little electronic hum, and it's largely drowned out by the normal splashing fountain sounds. I also like that the unit is super easy to dissemble and clean -- I can clean this fountain by myself in five minutes flat, with no snapping parts to wrestle into place. The only potential downside that I can see is that a really energetic dog or kitten might be able to shift the parts, but my cats are quiet senior adults and don't try to play in the fountain. I will also note that I like the shiny silver surface, but it seems to be losing a lot of luster in the short time since we've had it.

A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,"Most aquarium filters now use a motor to force water through some kind of filter pad which must be replaced at intervals.

AQ4CMYO94KVNR,"So, the color is pretty uninspiring. But the box itself is genius. I have 3 cats. A litter-scatter kitty, a back-up-and-pee-at-the-entrance kitty, and a disabled kitty whose back legs don't fully function.  The high sides defeat the litter scattering and the width gives Mr. Scatter plenty of room to dig around (15 pound Maine Coon). The way the entrance is cupped and curved upwards and a few inches long means Ms. Entrance-Pee's efforts just flow back down into the litter instead of onto the floor and then under the box. The box was a little high for the disabled kitty, so I put a flat cardboard scratcher at the entrance, like a small step. She really likes the box now.",AQ4CMYO94KVNR,"So, the color is pretty uninspiring. But the box itself is genius. I have 3 cats.

A24ENFFD43BFQJ,"This toy looks and sounds great.  I bought this toy as well as the ones shaped like a ball.  The squeeling sound is irresistable to dogs with any sort of prey drive and the colors are nice and bright.  However, if your dog is a heavy chewer, that is where the positives end.  My dog ripped the ball-shaped toy in half in less than 10 minutes and that was the end of that.  The stick shaped one stopped squeeking after my dog chewed off one end after 5 minutes, and had half of the toy chewed into 50+ pieces in about 15 minutes.  I overpaid for mine at a big box store and it ended up being $30 for about 15 minutes of fun and a big mess for me to clean up.",A24ENFFD43BFQJ,"This toy looks and sounds great.

A3613M2FLGZMAM,"This thing is great. LED lighting has its pros and cons and I like it more than the standard flouresent lights. No one makes better LED aquarium lights than Marineland - no one. Here are some basic pros and cons for LED over standard flouresent and LED in general.Pros:LED lighting is a clean white light that shimmers in the water&#34;spotlight&#34; effect in the water - the light is not evenly distributed but shines down like a spotlight and reflects off the glassVery thin, small, and light weightTakes up little spaceModern and sleek lookingVery bright for medium-large to large tanksVery little power consumptionNo heat at allDoes not cause water to evaporateNot big and clunky like flouresent lightsNever have to replace bulbs - light is guaranteed to last 17,000 hours (these 1 Watt LED's are rated to last 50,000 hours but Marineland only guarantees 17,000- so expect even longer life)Cons:The &#34;spotlight&#34; effect, although more natural and cooler looking, can be a con to some who dont like itFlouresent lights do not gives off a true white light like LEDs do, but the light they emit may be more pleasing to the eye for some - especially expensive flouresent lights. However, this is personal preference.Light is not emited in a 360 field of view - this ties into the spot light effect. Again, this is personal preferenceThe 'Single Bright' model, in my opinion, should only be used for small aquariums no larger than 20 gallons. You should get the 'Double Bright' or 'Reef Capable' versions. Not really a pro or a con but an FYI. It just isnt bright enough. I purchased the 'Single Bright' for my 50 gallon tank and sent it back for the 'Double Bright'. I'm much, much happier. The spot light and shimmer effect are much more dramatic and look amazing, the colors on the fish stand out, and the twilight night time mode is awesome. If I had the extra cash I might've sprung for the reef capable version but I probably would have blinded my fish.I love LED lighting over the old school flouresent lights. I think it looks great, shines bright, and makes an aquarium look more stylish and modern rather than having bulking tops. No one makes better LED lighting than Marineland. Amazon also has the best prices, this thing retails for almost $300 in stores.The Marineland Single, Double, and Reef lights have adjustable arms. So when you see the 24&#34;-36&#34; for example, the 24&#34; is how long the LIGHT actually is. The 36&#34; part of that is how long the arms on the sides of the light can extend in order to fit your tank. I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend getting the light the same length as your tank. So if your aquarium is 36&#34; long, get the 36&#34;-48&#34; light, NOT the 24&#34;-36&#34; light.

AGGAQLXPVGM5D,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE PETICURE POWER, PROFESSIONAL MODEL.I have a great dog with a good temperament.  However, to cut his nails and then spend a long time filing them takes a lot of time and patience on both the dog's and dog parent's part.Even with walking outside the nails are still sharp.  I saw an ad for the Pedipaws but searching on the internet, it was an offshoot from the Dremel and Peticure.Not having much experience with these devices, I compared the prices of the 3 models by Peticure.  There are three models: The Petite, Elite and Power.  The Petite and Elite come with 3 filing bands.  The Power which operates through a plug has 20 extra bands, is lighter and 2 times more powerful.  Given the fact that bands are $15 for 20, there is no reason to get nothing but the Power model (except for recharging capability).The 2 sheets that accompany the model are poorly written.  You have to refer to the company website to watch the videos on how to operate this.  Putting the thing together is not intuitive.  More explicit directions would have been better.You need to remove the plastic ring at the base of the head to attach the guard.  You push the lock button to untwist the mechanism to place the drum on the unit.The noise is a moderate pitched whirring sound.  My dog was not frightened by it.  There are preset ports that the nail is placed into.  Stabilize the pet's finger and use quick strokes to file the nail.  After some awkwardness of the operator, me, I got the hang of it.  There are videos on the website to direct you.  Dewclaws (at least on my dog's) were impossible to file.  The guard prevents but does not entirely eliminate the possibility of hair getting caught into the mechanism so be careful.After spending 3 times more effort assembling the unit versus actually using it, I was quite satisfied with it.If you are concerned about cutting your dog's nails but want something quicker to use, this is IT!  This helps me round out the 'sharp nails' that I have to deal with when my doggy greets us.Aside from the stated 4-6 weeks of receiving it from ordering, it was worth the wait.I highly recommend the PETICURE POWER, PROFESSIONAL MODEL.",AGGAQLXPVGM5D,"I have a great dog with a good temperament.

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Water Sufficient for Processing, Poultry By-Products, and Meat By-Products. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is by-products.  By-products are not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself.

AHVASC86C9VPS,"I previously owned the 19"" version. I am just going to copy my review for that size because every thing is same except for the size.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Addendum added January 28, 2013: My vet had never noticed these carriers because I had never put one up on the exam table until my last vet visit. She looked at it with interest and totally concurred with my opinion of having a small, but open carrier for my two (panicky) cats. She has seen more than a few overheated pets in too enclosed carriers. Since I live far from the vet I always carry spare towels for the bottoms of the carriers and she found that the ""stable floor covering'* I use was an additional comfort feature for my pets long trip to their appointments. (I just ordered the larger size pf this carrier for my ""Phat Kat"" and will donate her previous carrier to our local animal shelter.)NOTE: The ONLY possible drawback I have found of this carrier is the recessed (rather than luggage type) handle. There are circumstances where I feel some people will find it awkward.One suggestion I would like to make based on reviews by persons who had difficulty stuffing an unwilling cat into a carrier. When you get a carrier (first time or a new one) leave the carrier out in the open with the door open (away from high traffic areas) - especially with a piece of favorite bedding material inside. Cats, being curious by nature, will eventually investigate - and often curl up in a new enclosure. Since this carrier is so open, covering it with a towel should help. After you have seen the cat in the carrier, it should be easier to put the cat in the carrier when you need to - even if the cat ultimately equates the carrier with an unpleasant experience like a car ride or vet visit. I also recommend that everyone get a cat harness and a matching width (1/4"" to 3/8"" wide) webbing leash for travel. Also acclimate your cat to the harness by putting it on the cat when you first get it and then periodically after that until you actually need it. IGNORE the cat if it falls over in disgust and irritation, it WILL get over it! Then, anytime you use the carrier, have the harness and leash on the cat. If you are afraid that the leash will tangle around the cat you can gather it up and make a loose knot so it will hang above the cat's legs. Believe me, I have found it harder to get a cat out of a carrier at a vet's office than into a carrier at home. A harness and leash make it faster and SAFER for the cat because they will tend to eventually ""follow the tug on the body"" and give up spreading its legs out ""ala Garfield"" risking injury to legs or paws.I also suggest, even on outside cats, getting them used to being handled and occasionally having their claws clipped (on outside cats only take of a tiny amount except if they are going to the vet). THEN, always clip claws before you go to the vet unless you have docile cats. I no longer have to clip my cat's claws because they like our vet so much they purr so loudly she can barely check their heartbeats! But any cat, experiencing unexpected pain can turn into an angry cat and they will do less harm to the source of the pain if their cats can't snag the person!______________________________________________________________________________________________This carrier is very, very well made and well thought out, especially considering the VERY REASONABLE price. I can think of no negative things about the carrier.I purchased 2 of this ""small"" carrier for the two of my cats that are most insecure about car travel. Having a ""close fitting"" carrier gives the animals more of a sense of security. BUT, it is important that the animals do not get overheated, and these carriers are perfect in that regard due to the end and sides that open wire bars. You can always cover a carrier with a towel to provide warmth in cold weather, but if your carrier is not well enough ventilated there is little you can do to lower the temperature if it is too warm and your pet gets overheated.On the top of the carrier is a storage area that contains a (2 part - food / water) dish that hooks onto the inside of the door. That is a very handy bonus!*Note: since animals will slide around on the slippery floor, I cut a piece of corrugated cardboard to loosely fit the bottom of the carrier. I fold a towel securely around the cardboard and put it in the bottom of the carrier. I then put an additional folded towel on top of that (that can be replaced if/when necessary if soiled during the ""trip""). The ""anchored"" towel gives the animal additional feelings of security as it can ""dig in"" if it experiences travel ""discomforts"" (I live up in the mountains - 15 miles via a very windy/steep, bumpy road to the interstate - then 40 miles farther on to the vet, etc.). I very highly recommend this carrier, and the ""identical"" larger size that is also available.OH, and I was very glad the carrier came preassembled - I can absolutely understand how tricky this carrier would have been to assemble from scratch!!!",AHVASC86C9VPS,"Addendum added January 28, 2013: My vet had never noticed these carriers because I had never put one up on the exam table until my last vet visit.

But any cat, experiencing unexpected pain can turn into an angry cat and they will do less harm to the source of the pain if their sharp claws can't snag the person!______________________________________________________________________________________________This carrier is very, very well made and well thought out, especially considering the VERY REASONABLE price. I can think of no negative things about the carrier.I purchased 2 of this ""small"" carrier for the two of my cats that are most insecure about car travel. Having a ""close fitting"" carrier gives the animals more of a sense of security. BUT, it is important that the animals do not get overheated, and these carriers are perfect in that regard due to the end and sides that open wire bars. You can always cover a carrier with a towel to provide warmth in cold weather, but if your carrier is not well enough ventilated there is little you can do to lower the temperature if it is too warm and your pet gets overheated.On the top of the carrier is a storage area that contains a (2 part - food / water) dish that hooks onto the inside of the door. That is a very handy bonus!*Note: since animals will slide around on the slippery floor, I cut a piece of corrugated cardboard to loosely fit the bottom of the carrier. I fold a towel securely around the cardboard and put it in the bottom of the carrier. I then put an additional folded towel on top of that (that can be replaced if/when necessary if soiled during the ""trip""). The ""anchored"" towel gives the animal additional feelings of security as it can ""dig in"" if it experiences travel ""discomforts"" (I live up in the mountains - 15 miles via a very windy/steep, bumpy road to the interstate - then 40 miles farther on to the vet, etc.). I very highly recommend this carrier, and the ""identical"" larger size that is also available.OH, and I was very glad the carrier came preassembled - I can absolutely understand how tricky this carrier would have been to assemble from scratch!!!"

A3V0D97QKXDN5R,"I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.We had a cat develop some urinary problems: bladder stones which restricted her ability to urinate and caused some bleeding and she was trying to urinate all day long to help relieve the irritation. The Vet claimed it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food that causes the stones because the cat can't process enough liquid to handle the food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet dry special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit and chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meat varieties in pt&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is more, but urinates fewer times, now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food. In general, the cats prefer a dry food that's fish flavored.What we're doing is based on the information provided by Lisa A. Pierson, DVM on Making Cat Food (catinfo.org) and she is of the opinion that cats need the bones which makes the grinding process more difficult. We still feed them some kibble because feeding 7 cats, plus some strays, gets pretty expensive. It's a shame packaging is getting smaller and prices do nothing but remain the same or go up. We purchase the Merrick and Wild Buffalo grain free dry foods and the bags are now down to 11 lbs. each. However, when doing the math the canned food is still less expensive per serving.As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly.

The gravy is almost a gel like substance where the cans from the local stores are still pretty wet. Not sure what's up here but all the cans are well within the date range. If it continues... and the price continues to rise we'll stop buying them and even with 15% off and free shipping they cost more than at the food store... about 10 bucks for a 24-pack is pretty much what we pay at the food store though we will pay a bit more just to have it come in a case."
A2LAS014NSRW72,"My cats liked this dry food more than the usual grocery store brands I buy (Friskies, Meow Mix).  It is far less colorful than most cat foods, which I realize is because those cheaper brands want us humans to like the pretty colors and think it's more healthy.  In reality, cats don't care about the colors.This is a small pellet that goes a long way and gets finished by my cats (usually they leave some and then raccoons come and feast during the night on the waste). There isn't a terrible cat food odor like some brands.  My cats greatly preferred this flavor  rather than the chicken meal flavor, but they still ate that well.One thing is that the litter box doesn't stink up as much as other brands, and has less solid poo as a result.  That works for me!  As far as health benefits?  My cats are shiny and agile, but still shed.  I wish they'd find a way to fix that!!",A2LAS014NSRW72,"My cats liked this dry food more than the usual grocery store brands I buy (Friskies, Meow Mix).

A2214IKRIYZQM,"Using with the Zoo Med Hood. Combination of this light with a bluish white hue and the Zoo Med Flora Sun bulb with a pinkish hue. Six months of excellent growth of Amazon swords, Cryptocoryne wendtii and other variations, Anacharis and moss. The anchor moss exploded in growth under these lights.I do not use CO2 but I thought that my dwarf hairgrass would at least grow without it and I had good luck with another light in another tank carpeting my glossostigma but no luck in this tank under this light. I'm sure, however, the lack of implementing the CO2 is a contributing factor but I had no growth whatsoever of those two plants. Not even in height for the dhg. The hood that houses the bulbs sits on the tank itself which is a 20 gallon long so depth shouldn't be a factor.Will be ordering this light again.",A2214IKRIYZQM,"Using with the Zoo Med Hood.

A3DH53FPYSP9E,"My dog is a 65lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially from food. He can also be a bit of a picky eater so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, but I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on Nutrience Natural Healthy Adult Dog Food, 18-Pounds, Seven Fish Medley;Pros+ A nice healthy variety of fish, vegetables, fruit and supplements.+ All ingredients are made in North America (U.S.A. and Canada) which gives me a bit more piece of mind than foods containing ingredients from China.+ Easy to open re-sealable bag with a Velcro strip at the top to help keep food fresh longer.+ Dog loved it and gobbled it up quickly with no fuss.+ No corn, wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.+ A plethora of healthy and helpful ingredients such as Omega 3 & 6, antioxidants, vitamin C & E, glucosamine and chondroitin.+ My dog had no digestive issues after eating this.Cons- Kibble may be a bit too large for smaller or older dogs.- Velcro reseal on the bag isn't air-tight but it's obviously better than no seal at all.- Limited availability in brick and mortar stores.  As far as I can tell it's sold in Canada and online only at the moment.- Expensive for an 18-pound bag.  If you have larger or multiple dogs the price will get a bit hefty.- Strong fish smell, good for the enticing the dog but not so pleasant wherever you're storing the food.- Not Grain Free.My dog really enjoyed Nutrience Natural Healthy Adult Dog Food, 18-Pounds, Seven Fish Medley.  He was of course extremely excited when I approached with the bag (as he is with every new food) and quickly at the half cup I mixed into his bowl.  His current food isDiamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dogs, Large Breed 60+ Chicken Formula, 40 Pound Bagwhich he enjoys, but after introducing him to Nutrience he seems to prefer it over the Diamond brand.  Currently I'm still mixing the two foods until both are gone at which point I'll most likely switch completely toNutrience Grain Free Dog Food, 18-Pound, Ocean Fish.  Although the price is a bit high to purchase on a regular basis, I feel the savings will outweigh the cost of unnecessary veterinary visits due to allergies and infections caused by questionable ingredients in other foods.

I got on amazon.com the next day and ordered two of these, an extension and one for our chair and installed them the day they arrived.Not only do the cats and dog no longer get up on the furniture...they literally stay clear of it.

A3CN2OVKRVSFSF,"I bought 3 doggy products at the same time (all treat dispensing chew toys). This is my recommendation of the best product of the 3.I bought the Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toy along with a KONG classic and Premier Tug a Jug for my 3 month old, 4lb Morkie. My dog doesn't play with the latter 2, but LOVES the twist and treat! It's easy to twist the top off and insert the treats and to twist it down to the size you want to get it to dispense. Smoothie quickly learned how to dispense the treats, so we have it on its tightest setting (puppy chow is pretty small, so easy to get out). He chases and bats this all over the living room.He played with the classic Kong once, but because it dispenses the treats so quickly, he soon lost interest and went back to the twist and treat.He tries to play with the Tug a Jug, but he can never get anything out and quickly tires of it and goes back to the twist and treat.Of the 3, the twist and treat gets the most use, its the easiest to clean, is hardy, has the best movement for him to chase around, & is the perfect size for a toy dog.So, if you're looking to keep your dog entertained, don't waste money buying a bunch of products, just get the twist and treat.

A1IYJ6L7F548OO,"I chose the reduced calorie formula because my 8 year old rescue adopted miniature schnauzer was a little pudgy when I adopted him.

Also tried the Limited Ingredient Diet with duck with better results.Updated 10/15/13: My previous review was done before I discovered my now 11 year old and 5 year old (2nd adopted mini schnauzer) both have digestion and allergy issues. Some dogs just have more issues, and you have to pay attention to how they react to their food. I switched to Eartborn Holistic brand with much better results.

I looked high and low for Yeowww and bought this pack because my Persian Belle came to me with a Candy Cane that is now very very old and even made it though the washer ... and she still adores it.  Every cat in the house adores that old candy cane. It still has the wonderful catnip smell and attraction.  So when I found these new Yeowww products I went crazy and bought almost one of every item they had online on Amazon that day.  When they arrived, the cats turned up their noses and walked away.  The balls I bought got a little attention because they rolled, but that lasted about 2 minutes.  YEOWWW products appear to have declined in quality.

A2SSV6KM3W1VFD,In general my two german sheperds seem to like NoviPet products so we have tried a few of them. I cant' say anything dramatic about this product one way or the other at this time because I got several NoviPet products at once and still sorting out which are working best for them. It does seem their products are reliable and simply packaged. Its a brand I'll buy again and again as needed.I like the ease of opening the product and the simple packaging also.,A2SSV6KM3W1VFD,In general my two german sheperds seem to like NoviPet products so we have tried a few of them.

AS3UM0LHN7L1Y,"My dogs (2 Dachshunds, a Chihuahua and French Bulldog) LOVE RedBarn Chicken and Liver Dog Food Roll. And I love feeding it to them and here's why:1) It is MADE IN THE USA and contains NO corn or soy. The Lamb and Rice flavor is wheat free as well. Dogs can have or develop allergies to corn, soy or wheat.2) It is cooked in the casing for less nutrient loss and specially prepared and packaged without oxygen so that it will remain fresh at room temperature without the use of artificial preservatives such as BHA, BHT or Ethoxyquin.3) It is 93% digestible which means less dog poo and fewer cleanups.4) It is a complete and balanced meal, but it can also serve as a protein supplement when mixed with dry food.5) When cut in cubes, they make wonderful treats and training aids (yes, dogs find them that yummy).6) In a pinch (when I am out of Greenies pill pockets) a cubed piece can even be used to hide pet medications.Once you have sliced open the roll, you must seal and refrigerate the unused portion.

A20D9VGCF3P13L,"I got these and my female cat which weighs 8 pounds would eat the whole bag in one sitting, the male who weighs 10 likes one and walks away. Cats, go figure. I found that the male loves the Greenies though so I've got both covered. The only thing I can say is buy a pack and see if your cat will like them, no other way to know. I put in the cats weights as this crops up in other reviews.

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet.

The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. At least there is turkey in it, but other than that its all nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Other Friskies flavors are even worse than this one. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.",AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials.

A3DH53FPYSP9E,"My dog is a 65lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially from food. He can also be a bit of a picky eater so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, but I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on Nutrience Original Adult Medium Breed Dog Food, 18-Pounds, Chicken Meal with Brown Rice Recipe;Pros+ A nice healthy variety of chicken, vegetables, fruit and supplements.+ All ingredients are made in North America (U.S.A. and Canada) which gives me a bit more piece of mind than foods containing ingredients from China.+ Easy to open re-sealable bag with a Velcro strip at the top to help keep food fresh longer.+ Dog loved it and gobbled it up quickly with no fuss.+ No corn, wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.+ A plethora of healthy and helpful ingredients such as Omega 3 & 6, antioxidants, vitamin C & E, glucosamine and chondroitin.+ My dog had no digestive issues after eating this.Cons- Kibble may be a bit too large for smaller or older dogs.- Velcro reseal on the bag isn't air-tight but it's obviously better than no seal at all.- Limited availability in brick and mortar stores.  As far as I can tell it's sold in Canada and online only at the moment.- Expensive for an 18-pound bag.  If you have larger or multiple dogs the price will get a bit hefty.- Strong smell, good for the enticing the dog but not so pleasant wherever you're storing the food.- Not Grain Free.My dog really enjoyed Nutrience Original Adult Medium Breed Dog Food, 18-Pounds, Chicken Meal with Brown Rice Recipe.  He was of course extremely excited when I approached with the bag (as he is with every new food) and quickly at the half cup I mixed into his bowl.  His current food isDiamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dogs, Large Breed 60+ Chicken Formula, 40 Pound Bagwhich he enjoys, but after introducing him to Nutrience he seems to prefer it over the Diamond brand.  Currently I'm still mixing the two foods until both are gone at which point I'll most likely switch completely toNutrience Grain Free Dog Food, 18-Pound, Ocean Fish.  Although the price is a bit high to purchase on a regular basis, I feel the savings will outweigh the cost of unnecessary veterinary visits due to allergies and infections caused by questionable ingredients in other foods.

A2DPYMNI2HCIOI,"I have used Frontline for many years on my pets with no adverse reactions, only positive results.The impact of applying the product is almost immediate. I find that if you apply the product at the right time of the year, it can last several months. In warmer weather, when fleas are typically at their worst, I treat my cats and dogs in May and don't have to reapply the Frontline until July. If your pets live outside, I would anticipate greater use of the product.It may seem pricier than other products but 1) it works with a single application and 2)in my experience, one dose lasts several months. I was pleased to find the product on Amazon. I have purchased Frontline through Ebay but I no longer do this and the cost savings is not really substantial.  You could save a buck using Ebay but be taking a big risk.  The product may not be legitimate or could be expired.  In addition to these risks, sellers use not so customer friendly practices. Frequently, if you are purchasing Frontline for cats, the Ebay sellers will sell you a large vial of canine Frontline and tell you to divide the large vial into three or six portions.  So don't bother with it.The substance can leave a slightly greasy appearance in the spot of application. This does not really bother me.

A20BC3R2NBN646,"I noticed my dog was doing some major out-of-the-ordinary head shaking so I did a little research and thought he might have an ear infection, possibly from getting water in his ears during these hot summer days.  Before bringing him to the vet I decided to purchase this ear Solution as well as the Zymox Cleanser.  Once received I used the Otic Enzymatic Solution and put a drop in each ear and then used the ear cleanser to clean out his ears as well. Within 2 days the head shaking completely stopped so I can only attribute it to using the Zymox products.

They're the bedtime treat of choice for my two four-year-olds, who come running, no matter which of the five flavors I'm serving up that night:  roasted chicken, ocean fish, salmon, tuna or catnip.  I've noticed recently that prices here for the 5.5 oz. bags vary a lot from flavor to flavor and sometimes also from day to day.  For example, you can usually (but not always) find 5.5 oz. bags of Chicken Greenies for about $2.99 as an add on.  The recently introduced 5.5 oz. Catnip flavor was selling here for  over $10 a month ago but  at this writing is in the $7+ range, while the fish flavors can usually be had for prices  somewhere in between.

A23QDIORV9HICJ,"This collar allows my Doberman to run free off-leash on our unfenced property -- something she needs to do in order to burn off all of her energy.  This collar also keeps her from jumping on my little niece and nephew, and stops unnecessary barking.  We live between an elementary school and a church where a lot of strangers get together to play baseball, and this collar prevents her from running over there or barking at them.However, these collars are not waterproof as they claim; at least not on the beach or when exposed to saltwater.  We took her to the beach and let her off leash -- sand got in the remote and the collar got wet.  From then on, the collar would shock her out of the blue, but would do so more when it was raining outside.  PetSafe did exchange the collar and remote for another set since I had it less than 8 months (but it was a refurbished, scratched-up set).  When we went to the beach with the new collar, I zipped up the remote in a ziploc bag and did not allow my dog to saturate the collar.....I thought if the sand stayed out of the remote and the saltwater did not soak the collar, then all would be well.  Nope.  Same thing happened to this second set after the beach trip -- she would get shocked out of the blue, and every time when it was drizzling rain.  PetSafe could not replace the second defective unit because they discontinued this set over a year ago.  I'm now stuck with a collar that I will not use when it's damp outside (which is quite a lot in my area).EDIT 5/30/14:  I still have my original box of the collar that PetSafe told me was discontinued.  It is PDT00-11876, what PetSafe is saying on this website is the ""updated version.""  I don't appreciate being lied to by their customer service.  It seems my replacement collar was an old scratched up crap thing and when I complained about it also not functioning properly, they tell me it's now out of stock.  VERY POOR SERVICE.  I'm shopping for a collar for my Siberian Husky and will find another brand.My Doberman sometimes yelps when shocked on 2, and screams on 3.  The #1 shock startles her enough -- I believe my unit sends a stronger charge than normal because there is no way I could use the higher setting without causing heart failure.  Fortunately, she quickly became collar-smart so that all I have to do is put the collar on her and she'll stop barking without me needing to beep or shock her.The collar does have a beep tone that does not shock -- I always beeped then shocked when first training her, so now all I have to do is beep her without shocking to get her to stop jumping or to come back in her yard.I've shocked my own wrist on setting 2 -- it is just like an electrical shock, like when coming in touch with a live wire or putting a battery on your tongue.  It's a strong, startling, vibrating type of feeling; but not a stinging pain.These collars are generally very safe, and allows me to keep a very hyper dog under control.  The dog appreciates being able to remain off-leash when on our 4-acre property so she can run at full steam (which she does 4-5 times each day).  I feel fewer dogs would end up at the pound if people would learn to use these collars humanely on their pets.  They are not useful for housetraining (only consistency, crate-training, and a short leash worn in-house will do that), but they are a savior for dogs who run off, run into the street, chase other animals, bark excessively, or jump on people.",A23QDIORV9HICJ,"Original review written March 2013:  This collar allows my Doberman to run free off-leash on our unfenced property -- something she needs to do in order to burn off all of her energy.

A58P1TUC17EL2,Put in the everlasting treats into the treat ball and my dog Samson goes nuts for hours. rolling playing kicking and eating his treats.Pros:the ball is durable.Its fun to roll as it goes all over the place.My dog loves this toy/treat combo.It keeps him actively running around happy.Hes not able to pry them out so he cant eat it all at once.Cons:everlasting treat is full of starches and other not so good for your dog ingredients. (this is the recommended treat for the ball but you can put others inside instead)Overall i love this for a once a month treat. But if your overly worried about your dogs diet i would move onto a different treat such as Pet 'n Shape Chik 'n Rice Balls Dog Treats. which can also be put into the ball.,A58P1TUC17EL2,Put in the everlasting treats into the treat ball and my dog Samson goes nuts for hours. rolling playing kicking and eating his treats.Pros:My dog loves this toy/treat combo.It keeps him actively running around happy.Hes not able to pry them out so he cant eat it all at once.Cons:Full of starches and other not so good for your dog ingredients.Overall i love this for a once a month treat.

AZG0XARYMT82I,"I cannot imagine anyone not loving this product. It works perfectly, every single time. I started it on the first day with the automatic timer running twice a day. I didn't like the smell that lingered for about 10 minutes after the drying cycle, so I scheduled it to run while I am at work and also during the middle of the night. It's relatively quiet, amazingly clean, and as an added bonus, it's cheap entertainment for my three cats.I have a big Maine Coon, a finicky Siamese, and a rambunctious Himalayan kitten who likes to fling the litter everywhere. Buying the sidewalls, dome cover and floor mats solved that problem. Even with two long-haired cats, I have had no problems with hair clogs.The few negative things that other people have said about the customer service does not reflect my experience. The service I got was polite, helpful and appreciative of my business.Bottom line: If my CatGenie exploded tomorrow, I would buy another one before nightfall. I can't say enough good things about this amazing product. If you hate scooping litter, value an odor-free home, and adore your kitties, then you should buy this machine. It's safe, convenient, sanitary, and a LOT cheaper than using traditional methods, especially when you consider the value of your time. It doesn't use very much water or electricity and if you buy the cartridges in bulk directly from the company, the cost is very reasonable.

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.",AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials.

AARA8N72MJMEF,"I wrote this review also under Nite Out II's sister product, Special Blend, and am copying it here because the 2 products go hand in hand.My buddy Bubba died.  Bubba was a 13 inch King Kong Red Parrot Cichlid that was like a dog in a tank.  When he died, I didn't wanted another fish right away so my tank sat empty for well over a year and was an eyesore. I finally decided to set the tank back up, but I was not in the mood to wait a month to achieve a good cycle with some silly goldfish or something.  I went to my favorite aquarium shop and asked them what I could use to obtain a fast cycle...and NO I don't want that CYCLE stuff they sell at Petco.  Without hesitation, the freshwater guru reached behind the counter and gave me 2 things.  He gave me Special Blend and he gave me Nite Out II by the same company. (I posted a link for Special Blend below) He said they need to be used in conjunction to achieve a full cycle, and the dosing instructions are very clear on the bottle.  He stressed that you MUST SHAKE THEM.  This is basically a bottle of bacteria which tends to settle on the bottom of the bottle.  No shake, no results. Read, read, read the bottle.  It tells you to shake, tells you to keep the lights off for about 72 hours so that the light does not interfre with the bacteria's life cycle before they can establish and it tells you to use the Special Blnd on certain days and the Nite Out every other day. OH...and hold your nose. The rotten egg stink on the Special Blend will make your hair stand on end, but goes away quickly.  Nite Out II is odorless. Anyway....within 2 weeks I had a gorgeous cycle.  Ammonia, zero. Nitrites, zero.  Nitrates, acceptable. Water, clear.  I adore this stuff.  I use it after gravel cleaning, water changes or filter media swaps and the beneficial bacteria seems to be healthy and active in doing their job.  I did a little research on this company because I had never heard of them before, but it seems they have been in the pond industry for quite some time and just recently broke into the home aquarium market. And they mean business.  They are not fooling around. I don't think I have ever seen a cycle occur so quickly.LINK TO SPECIAL BLEND:Microbe-Lift Special Blend for Home Aquariums, 16-Ouncehttp://www.amazon.com/Microbe-Lift-Special-Blend-Aquariums-16-Ounce/dp/B000YQ2K9O/ref=pd_bxgy_petsupplies_img_y",AARA8N72MJMEF,"My buddy Bubba, a 13 inch King Kong Red Parrot Cichlid died.

AWACMOPMYAHPU,"Set on medium, this deters all 5 cats from walking/napping/sitting on the stove. Makes a snapping noise on some surfaces if using the plug in adapter, so it's placed over two thick dishtowels. All 'testers' (human, short-haired, and long-haired cats), are only annoyed by the medium setting. No lingering distress, or concern.After checking them with the back of my hand first, before leaving them in place, I've accidentally tested them without warning, after that.  I've set my hand/arm down, many times now, on another mat, across another kitchen counter. It's also set on medium. It's not pleasant, but not exactly painful either.If you have nervous cats, simply use the low setting. Our only 'twitchy' cat was able to observe, from across the room, that he didn't want to try it himself. Might not be as simple in a single cat household, and all cats are different.Wish these were made in 6 inch, by 16-30 inch strips (to place in front of the toaster oven, etc), as the little strip is too small to be effective. (The paws simply get placed to either side of the 3&#34; strip.) I could also possibly, carefully, use a 6&#34; strip on the front area of a stove, and cook on the back.  Really frustrating to babysit a soup, on simmer, for hours.Using a slow cooker, in the laundry room, but as soon as that cat figures out how to open the door to the room, I'll have to babysit it too. A reasonably wide strip would help deter him from fussing with that door, and not interfere with short legged walking humans carrying laundry, as well.Not entirely sure a strip would stop Mr. Cat-of-steel from getting in the toaster oven, actually.  He continues to burn off his whiskers, head fur, and ear fur, when he opens the toaster oven, then sticks his huge head in. However he does jump off the other mats, immediately. So, I would hope a burning face, and an uncomfy hind end/paws, might (possibly) make him re-think doing his 'just used toaster oven crumb check'.

ADHYEIYUDKL1K,"I have a lovely snowshoe siamese named Mocha and she loves this. she isnt a big eater....as in she likes to eat little bits here and there with all types of food offered to her. I feed about 1/3 a can of this and sometimes mix in fresh cooked meat or fresh green vegetables for her nightly meal. i do want her eating fresh food as i believe any processed food isnt good for anyone--man or animal. Mocha isnt a fan of fresh food, unfortunately...and loves dry cat kibble which isnt the best for cats. :(Anyway, as stinky as this classic fancy feast is, she seems to like it. she will either devour the whole serving i give her or will eat a bit at a time until it's all gone in the AM.  Of all the classic fancy feast flavors, my Mocha loves the chicken one.  i notice she will devour it in one setting and give me 'i want more' look afterwards.  LOLOf all fancy feast foods, these classic types are the 'better' ones if your cat is diabetic (do google search) as this has more protein (13% crude protein) compared to grilled version. I havent tried those tuscany, mediteranean newer ones yet though.i myself do subscribe and save (SS) cause i save so much more this way.  i notice in grocery stores, the sale price for fancy feast is usually around $10 excluding tax. So doing the math, SS saves alot of money.  I also do an online reward program that allows me to get $25 in monthly amazon gift cards for free so really, i get this for free. yay! thanks amazon AND to my fav. rewards program.  =)",ADHYEIYUDKL1K,"I have a lovely snowshoe siamese named Mocha and she loves this.  she isnt a big eater....as in she likes to eat little bits here and there with all types of food offered to her.

Bailey knew he had an issue as he tried constantly to clean up after himself, I started using this and he was so much happier!  Now a few pointers!!The pads are not worth the money!! They are not very absorbent, They do not stick well at all and if they get a tad damp forget it they fall off, they crunch up in the wrap making them useless and more expensive the female products soooooo...I used Poise Ultra Absorbent people pads inside and they were fantastic VS the Simple Solutions pads which sadly were terrible and a total waste of money. Simple Solution pads are just over priced expensive Kotex pads that could not handle the amount of urine that can occur unlike the Poise pads, remember this is what Poise pads are used for. You should get the ones that fit how much you dog drips so it may take some experimenting my dog was large so mine were the most absorbent I could get. Great thing is you can get them in-store and on sale almost anywhere!I bought baby wipes to wipe him down and keep him clean, remember it is the same concept as a baby wearing a diaper and sitting in it, I didn't want to risk any infection. No alcohol!Make sure you measure your dog, to tight can cause a lot of chafing!! Mine was the right size but I ended up sewing micro-fiber cloth on the elastic part where the material scrunched up as this was causing chafing behind his manly area. He was not use to anything rubbing his skin in that area and the material is pretty stiff. I had to leave it off till it healed and sadly I never had the chance to see if the microfiber would have relieved the problem. Make sure you check your dog to make sure this is not occurring due to some dogs have a higher tolerance to pain. It would be great if they could use a softer material in the elastic area.

A3S3R88HA0HZG3,"We've been purchasing Halo dog and cat foods for some time because our dogs and cats like them.

For a while we made food for our dogs and cats with people food ingredients. But while the dogs loved it, it was hard to get the cats to make the change. And it's nice to be able to leave dry food out for the casual grazers. We still make some, but supplement with Halo.This is one of the few foods that hasn't been recalled and their website states that they don't use meat or chicken ""meal"" in their foods.

All the whiners claim that such-and-such is too corm or soy heavy, or that it is not gluten free or some other such crap.  Guess what...It's DOG FOOD! For the love of all that is holy would you tools quit your whine-fest and go away!  For the record, this product did exactly what it was supposed to do.  Do you know what that is?  It fed my dogs.  Furthermore, they all seemed to enjoy it and have not shown any ill effects or digestive ailments (Not a single degree higher on the dog-fart scale, so I am happy).  Sure our dogs are our babies, but the same people who cry about dog food ingredients are the same ones who took the score out of childrens' sports and think everyone is a winner.  Total and complete imbeciles.  Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food will always be welcome in my home.  Our pets are only given a short time with us on this planet, so why not let them enjoy their little lives to the fullest.  Give them what they want.

A1P6W8BHV33LJW,I have two black lab mixes. We had been giving them rawhides for their chewing pleasures. Well our newest lab chews ALOT. We were giving him way too much rawhide to keep him from chewing furniture etc. So I was in Petsmart and saw a Heavy chewers section. I bought one there to try it out and boy am I glad I did. So for Christmas time I ordered a selection from Amazon and they have been a HUGE hit. He loves chewing on them and they are holding up well. The only issue with this one is that only the small end is getting chewed on at this point. I also don't have to worry about the amount of rawhide he's getting!

AEL6CQNQXONBX,"We recently tried the Turkey, Chicken and Herring variety of this dog food. It comes in an 18 lb. bag and the top is supposed to easily pull apart. The bag didn&#8217;t open easily so I had to open it with scissors. The bag has a Velcro seal built-in which I found to be odd. Most dog food bags don&#8217;t seal at all so I was surprised to see that you could seal it back up. I was even more surprised to see that it sealed with Velcro. I am not sure how air tight Velcro is but I guess it&#8217;s sure a lot better than no seal at all. I guess a Ziploc type of seal would probably be a pain on such a large bag and the Velcro is easy to seal so it does make sense.This dog food contains deboned turkey, chicken, herring and whole egg. It also contains lentils, sweet potatoes, fruits, vegetables, botanicals and coconut oil. As well as various other healthy supplements including glucosamine, chondroitin, prebiotics and probiotics.It doesn&#8217;t include any grain, soy, artificial colors or flavors, by-products or preservatives. I strongly believe that this food is very good for my dogs.We have two Chihuahua&#8217;s who can be picky eaters at times. They will eat most food but they seem to like the cheaper and simpler foods better for some reason. You know the ones that are probably the worst for them. I love what this dog food has to offer. You can&#8217;t go wrong with quality and natural ingredients combined with fruits, vegetables and nutrients. I love that there is nothing at all artificial about it. I am sure it&#8217;s probably one of the healthiest foods on the market for dogs. All that being said my picky dogs aren&#8217;t that excited about it. I think mainly they are used to the healthier type of foods. It may very well be the fruit that turns them off. They will eat little bits of it here and there but they certainly aren&#8217;t excited about it. I had to start mixing a little bit of it along with other food.This dog food is made in the USASo overall I think this is one of the highest quality foods on the market right now but you might want to try a sample before purchasing a large bag of food and finding out that your dog doesn&#8217;t like it.",AEL6CQNQXONBX,"We recently tried the Seven Fish Medley variety of this dog food.

A34OJWGNJAOPUZ,"Your mileage may very, it seems that this product either works, or doesn't, with really nothing in between, but it worked for me so I recommend trying it.DAP and it's counterpart FELIWAY were recommended to me as a way of helping animals deal with stress. We have a rescue dog who is adapting to a house with 2 cats who have had full-claim of their home for several years. Both sides are stressed at the changes and have been showing it in various ways.Our puppy is crated to sleep, and usually likes her little den and bed. During the night, though, she will bark, yip, and whine for anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, 3 or 4 times per night. We've gone up to 4 hours straight of barking right in the middle of the night. Any time there's so much as a strong breeze which shifts the house she'll start up. We're afraid to get up for water or anything like that because any noise (or sometimes even no noise) will set her off.I can't overstate how skeptical I was about this product, but this was a last-ditch effort to save my sanity so I figured it couldn't possibly hurt. I plugged this thing in right above her crate. For the last couple weeks it has been running non-stop and there hasn't been a single incident of mid-night barking. Not a single one. No whining, no yips, no howls, it's like we have a new dog.To take this a step further, normally if someone walks near her crate after she's been sleeping for a bit she'll jump up and start hopping around in there. She'll bark if you don't come let her out. She actually destroyed one crate this way, and has broken several of the metal bars on her newest crate. This morning I walked right past her den and she stood up, yawned, realized I wasn't coming over to her, and lay right back down calmly. She waited that extra minute until I came over to let her out, then stepped out slowly, no mad bull-rush out the door.I'm still skeptical, part of me can't help but feel that this must be coincidence, but I'm willing to pay for a monthly refill if only for my peace of mind.

A2E3B0FA7ZRKOY,"Note: I initially posted this review 2 years ago for the 12 oz and 4 oz packages but just noticed they now have a 22 oz bag so I'm copying my review here.When I had heard enough about dogs getting sick or dying after eating Chinese chicken jerky, I went looking for products made in the US and found this and have ordered several 1 lb bags. When fewer and fewer vendors were listed on amazon and the price quadrupled from my last purchase, I called the manufacturer to see if they had stopped making the product. The person said no, they had reformulated it so I waited for that to show up. Now it has so I went back to the manufacturer's web site to see what they changed.I was appalled by what I found. From my bags of the old product here is a list of the ingredients. Chicken, natural smoke flavor. That's all.Here's the reformulated product ingredient list: Chicken, betaine, brown sugar, cultured dextrose, sea salt, natural smoke flavor, garlic powder, mixed tocopherols (preservative), paprika extract color, rosemary extract.I didn't know what betaine was so I looked it up on the net. After reading about it, I still don't know what it is.The crude protein dropped from 77% to 50%.crude fat increased from 2% to 5%.moisture increased from 18% to 28%.I am not going to give this product to my dog and will make my own chicken jerky in the oven._________________Update:I just went to a new Petco that opened near me.

A2E3B0FA7ZRKOY,"Note: I initially posted this review 2 years ago for the 12 oz and 4 oz packages but just noticed they now have a 22 oz bag so I'm copying my review here.When I had heard enough about dogs getting sick or dying after eating Chinese chicken jerky, I went looking for products made in the US and found this and have ordered several 1 lb bags. When fewer and fewer vendors were listed on amazon and the price quadrupled from my last purchase, I called the manufacturer to see if they had stopped making the product. The person said no, they had reformulated it so I waited for that to show up. Now it has so I went back to the manufacturer's web site to see what they changed.I was appalled by what I found. From my bags of the old product here is a list of the ingredients. Chicken, natural smoke flavor. That's all.Here's the reformulated product ingredient list: Chicken, betaine, brown sugar, cultured dextrose, sea salt, natural smoke flavor, garlic powder, mixed tocopherols (preservative), paprika extract color, rosemary extract.I didn't know what betaine was so I looked it up on the net. After reading about it, I still don't know what it is.The crude protein dropped from 77% to 50%.crude fat increased from 2% to 5%.moisture increased from 18% to 28%.I am not going to give this product to my dog and will make my own chicken jerky in the oven._________________Update:I just went to a new Petco that opened near me. I found a 1 lb package of Colorado Naturals Chicken Jerky Dog Treats. Made in the US.Ingredients: Chicken breasts, natural flavorings.Crude protein: 70%.Crude fat: 3-7%.Moisture: 10%.I will be buying these once I use up my old stock of True Chews.____________Update 2 (8/17/13):Since its been over a year since I last looked at True Chews, I decided to see if they've changed their product.

In addition, he seems to hate, not just dislike, but HATE my father, who lives with us. Dad's always been nice to Rex, but Rex will often swat at him when he walks by. Rex also is very defensive of the house and anytime another cat comes by the house, he runs from door to door and window to window stalking it, and then sometimes sprays near the doors.--- Princess, my father's cat, seems to suffer from OCD. Besides being skittish around new people, she will lick herself until she has large bald patches on her legs. The vet has put a couple kids through college with the money she's taken off my father, but Princess never seems to improve.After being recommended by the new vet my father has found, we decided to give Feliway a shot and bought the diffuser and one refill. Dad has it installed in his bedroom, and from the first night it was in use, he said Princess started sleeping on the side of the bed nearest the diffuser. She seems to be less skittish around visitors. She used to disappear the whole time they were in the house. Now she will come out and sit at a distance and watch people. Dad says Rex seems to be a little nicer to him, and spends more time in his room (Rex used to just go in the room to use that litter box and see if any of Princess' food was left out).I wouldn't say that Feliway has made a huge difference in our home, but there have definitely been some changes in behavior in our cats, so it certainly does something. If you are living paycheck to paycheck, the small difference it makes (at least if you have similar results to us) in cat behavior probably wouldn't justify the added expense.

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the friskies flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.",AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials.

A1HN7OLEVRJ7DD,"I have used Breeze system for years and I love it, but the 'refill' products are enormously overpriced for what they are. I decided to try 1 pkg of these hugely less expensive Ware River Pet pads - they are not just a little cheaper, they are ENORMOUSLY cheaper.I sprinkle a thin sprinkling of 'Arm & Hammer - Oxiclean - Pet Fresh Carpet Odor Eliminator with Vacuum Booster' on the tray/drawer before I put the pad in and then a little directly on the pad (I keep it in a flip-top McCormick spice bottle for convenience and so a little goes a long way).I turn the pad drawer around every day or two (my cat pees in one spot) and sprinkle a little on the used portion (this also helps me see when to change it). I think the urine spreads through the entire pad a little better than Breeze, which seems to keep it in one spot, instead of spreading it through the pad. Maybe that's why the Ware River Pet pad seems to dry out better instead of staying so heavy-wet.I do prefer the way the Breeze pads are packaged and folded, but apparently that costs extra????  I would be quite happy with less fancy, less expensive packaging, if the price was lower - and I would quit looking for something else and stick with the Breeze refill products and continue to recommend the system.  I can't conscientiously recommend this system while the pads cost over $1 each.I change the pad maybe a day or two sooner than the Breeze ones, but even if they lasted half as long, they would STILL be WAY, WAY cheaper.  And I like being able to afford to keep clean pads in the tray.The Tidy Cats Breeze Pads may LOOK better - be packaged better - but they don't WORK THAT much better than the Ware River Pet pads.  Considering the huge cost savings, it couldn't hurt to give them a try (try sprinkling the carpet stuff mentioned above too - under and over the pad - the spice jar can spread it evenly and thinly to make it last longer (a year later and I'm still not halfway through my first box)).I'm still looking for pads to replace the over-priced Breeze pads.  Someone should start making some pads that fit the tray and work well - some real competition might get the prices into a reasonable range, relative to their manufacturing cost.  They wouldn't have to be as inexpensive as the Ware River pads, which are REALLY inexpensive.  If the price was just $1 or less, AND they worked WELL, I would be satisfied.  I would be satisfied with the Breeze pads at $1 each, even though I'm sure they cost less than 50 cents (maybe 25 cents, or less) to manufacture.I have been recommending the Breeze system all over the place.

AE4PE48Q2794I,"My cat is allergic to Frontline and Advantage, which are topical pesticides that get ingested when the cat grooms itself. He would get a lump on his neck wherever I would apply it, so I stopped using topical insecticide for flea control.I really like Program, and I use it in conjuction with Capstar if he picks up live fleasEven if your cat has a flea infestation, just give them Capstar and then use Program. Capstar which works faster than anything else, and kills all the fleas on your cat in 5 minutes, but is not long-lasting.Although Capstar doesn't work for more than 30 minutes, it kills all the biting fleas and it is actually safe for kittens and animals that are sick. I used to work at a veterinary hospital and they gave Capstar and Program to animals that were infested with fleas, but sick, since they are safer alternatives to Advantage and Frontline (read the insert for Advantage, it actually says that it's not safe for sick animals OR kittens).The people that give this product a bad review need to realize that if you cat is infested, you need to do something about the active fleas and the eggs. Program is an ovacide that prevents fleas from reproducing so it won't stop an infestation, but it's so much safer for your cat. Capstar works instantly to kill all biting fleas, but it won't last. So if you use both, you can control fleas completely without using a topical pesticide that is dangerous to your cat when it grooms itself.As a side note, if your cat (or dog) ingest the fleas while they are grooming or licking themselves, sometimes they will get tapeworms, which look like little grains of rice near their anus and bedding. My cat gets tapeworms about every 2 years or so. You can purchase tapeworm tabs without a prescription now in the US. The medicine is called Praziquantel and is available online for about $15.

Best is when you first clip the hair away with shears that have rounded ends (secure).After you cleaned the area with ""Precious Essentials German Chamomile Blended w/Jojoba "" take a Q-Tip with a little warm water , not wet just damp, and take the intensity away. Then take a cotton pad (flat rounds are best)and completely dry it (essential). Than dip your pinky finger in some Johnson's Baby Powder, Pure Cornstarch (important), Lavender & Chamomile, 15 oz. by Johnson & Johnson and press gently onto the area--leave it like that (not in eyes-don't get the powder too close). You are done. Do this twice a day and soon your dog's tear stains will be gone. Sounds a lot , but it's actually not more than 5 minutes.Let me know what you think.

A27DDHWHE540I5,"We don't have any dogs...but...through my landscaping company, I'm the ""Auntie"" to 27 pups and pooches that are my clients pets. Each one of them is adorable and greets me with fervent kisses; I've always felt sad that I had nothing to reward their loving behavior. Now, I do!I ordered both this jerky and the smoked jerky treats and showed each client with a fur baby the ingredients before even attempting to give them a treat; most were very receptive to my giving them a treat but a couple were ""He/She won't eat it! They're VERY fussy!"" Guess what? Those 'fussy' dogs sure proved their owners wrong!There are far fewer sticks to this treat than the slabs of the smoked jerky, so I broke the sticks in half with a poultry shear so the pieces were substantial enough to be chewed and not just gulped down. Every doggie from mutt to pricey import LOVED the taste of these treats and acted like that cartoon dog that is bonkers for bacon. Although the bag is resealable, I tossed them into a freezer Ziploc bag which is far more secure.A happy dog is a thing of beauty, but a happy customer is priceless! :D",A27DDHWHE540I5,"We don't have any dogs...but...through my landscaping company, I'm the ""Auntie"" to 27 pups and pooches that are my clients pets.

AE4PE48Q2794I,"Capstar is safe for use in cats and dogs that are sick. It is the Best medicine to stop an infestation-- you will see the fleas actually die before your eyes (not an exaggeration) put your dog or cat on a white towel and give him/her capstar and just watch what happens.

AKZKG2Z7CNV27,"Revised: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) Water sufficient for processing, fish, poultry, meat by-products, wheat gluten. How disgusting is that?! ""Fish"" and ""poultry""?? Not really sure how that can be counted as an ingredient...not ""tuna"" or ""salmon"" but ""fish."" Not ""chicken"" or ""turkey"" but ""poultry."" If it was a decent quality meat- they wouldn't feel the need to hide behind ambiguous terms. Then there's the by-product which is the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, pure, meat, and there just isn't real identifiable meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself.
